The \textbf{Jlp22} software is the newest version of \textbf{J} software. Don Shepard told via Fortran Discourse that
that there is already \textbf{J} programming language. In order to avoid confusion,
the name of \textbf{J} is now changed
into \textbf{Jlp22}, the name which shows the inheritance from JLP. The name \textbf{J} was used in everything which  happened
to the software before this point.
In the current version \textbf{Jlp22}, the beef if still the linear programming in forest management planning.
But \textbf{Jlp22} has so many tools for
data management and numeric computations,	that also vegetarians can use it.
Perhaps these tools will be first used for preprocessing  data and postprocessing
the results in conjuction of linear programming. The random number generators
provide possiblities to do risk computations related to linear programming within \textbf{Jlp22}.

\subsection*{History of \textbf{J} before Luke}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{History of \textbf{J} before Luke}

JLP is the linear programming (LP) software I made for the forest planning system Mela
which was created by Markku Siitonen in Finnish Forest Researc Institute (Metla). In Mela, a simulator generates a large number of treatment schedules
for each stand in a group of stands. In an optimization problem a linear combination of sums of
variables (e.g. amount of harvested sawlogs dutring a period) produced in treatments is maximized or minimized subject to constraints which are also
linear combinations of variables. JLP was published 1992 and
Finnish Forest Research Institute (Metla) started to distribute it.
I wrote most part of it when payed by Academy of Finland. I reinvented  the generalized
upper bound technique of Dantzik and Van Slyke. The key idea is to remove with algebraic tricks
the area constraints which
tell that areas of different schedules add to the total area of the stand. In a typical problem the data can consist of 10000 stands, and and
optimization problem can consist of 10 contraints for the sums ofe variables. Using an ordinary LP software
in one iterative optimization step, a matrix consisting of 100200100 elements is updated.
In JLP the equivalent
step is computed by updating a matrix consisting 100 elements.
NMBU started to use JLP from the beginning in its GAYA software which was then called GAYA-JLP.
JLP allowed to compute new variables from the simulated variables. It allowed also to add
nicely constraints for domains, i.e. subsets of stands. JLP was programmed
in Fortran77, which did not have
dynamic allocation, pointers or own data types.

I wrote \textbf{J} as a successor for JLP. First version of \textbf{J},
version 0.9.3 was published in August 2004. The beef in \textbf{J} was the same linear programming
algorithm as in JLP. \textbf{J} was written in Fortran90 and now
it probably contains properties
of newer Fortrans. \textbf{J} uses in linear programming matrix
suboutines of Roger Fletcher which I changed to double precision. \textbf{J} provided many new possibilities
for preprocessing of data and postprocessing of results, and these computations
can be uased  also without LP problems.
Even Bergseng from NMBU
started to use \textbf{J} in a premature face and thus he had to tolerate quite much mix-up. The GAYA
started to use \textbf{J} in the planning system called thereafter GAYA-\textbf{J}. Mela has not
included \textbf{J} as
as the optimizer, but it is possible to pull out simulated schedules from Mela and then
define and solve linear programming problems using \textbf{J}.

Simosol started to use \textbf{J} as an
optimizer from the beginning. Simosol has privately admitted,
that they using much \textbf{J}.
For some reason Simosol
wants to keep this hidden from the users of their sofware and from the public.
It would be important for an open source software that
the users would rise a flag when they use the sofware.
This would give feedback to the developers
and would allow communication between users.

\textbf{J} version 2.0. published in 2013 made it possible optimize simultatenously
forestry and transportations to factories
and factory production. I extended the generalized upper bound tehcnique
for constraints which tell that
all harvested timber volume in a stand is transported somewhere.
Reetta Lempinen started to work with me in the factory optimization.
Reetta has professional
training in programming, while I'm a self-learning amateur.
Reetta had a clear head to keep complicated data structures I had created in order.
She also maintained the spirit during the black moments.



\subsection*{J in Luke}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{J in Luke}

When working with Reetta, I noticed how terribly dirty the code was. I started to clean the
code.
In 2015 Metla and
two other institutes were merged into Institute of Natural Resources Finland (Luke).
When my retirement was approaching, I suggested Luke that \textbf{J} would be published as
an open source software so that I could continue its development after my retirement.
The leaders of Luke told that it is a good idea to open the software, and this is so important that
Luke cannot let me take care of the publication but the leaders wanted to publish \textbf{J}
themselves. This started a frustrating and humillating process which lasted until 7.10. 2021. None
of the involved eleven leaders thought that the software had been even so
important that he/she had taken care that it had been eventually published.

The following leading persons were involved in
process before my retirement in 2017: P\"aivi Eskelinen, Olli Salminen, Kari T. Korhonen,
Kimmo Kukkavuori,
Tuula Packalen, Sirpa Thessler, Sari Forsman-Hugg, Emilia Katajajuuri and Johanna
Buchert. Iikka Sainio was an outside legal consult.
After my retirement prof. Packalen and after she left Luke in 2020
research director Antti Asikainen, head of adiministration Ilkka P. Laurila,
and  the director general Johanna Buchert
took the control of the publication.

In the previous version of this manual I wrote a detailed description of the process, e.g.
of the farce related
to the subroutines of Roger Fletcher. Now I present only some key points.
The process can be described as a hostile take over.
The leading lawyer Emilia Katajajuuri stated it
explicitly: 'Listen Juha, you do not decide anything in this matter'.
P\"aivi Eskelinen told that I should wait
patiently because the leaders want to prepare
the publication carefully.



At the time when I retired in March 2017 I was told that the decision was
ready to be signed by Sari Forsman-Hugg.
She was not able to decide, similarly as as she was not able to
decide whether Luke could take me as an outside researcher.


Research director Johanna Buchert signed the opening decision 30. 8. 2017.
Buchert nominated prof Packalen to take care of the launch.
I was not informed of the decision. When I heard that such decision has been made,
I asked prof. Packalen what it contained.
She did not remember. The software was used in a tiny research project utilizing factory optimization.
I had sent to Luke a bug correction beleaving  that the
publication was approaching as prof Packalen had promised. She suggested a
high-level launch with oversees attendees. I did not like such
launch because
the software was not yet ripe
for that. I would be ashamed if the prominent guests would look at the code.
Prof Packalen then prevented without any notice the publication altogether by not allowing
Reetta Lempinen to do necessary preparations.
Research director Buchert did not follow how prof Packalen was doing
the launch.

Prof Packalen left Luke in June 2020 and could thus no
more prevent the publication.
In February 2021 Hannu Salminen started to discuss
with me of the development and utilization of \textbf{J}.
He was the first person in Luke's
history wanting to discuss such things with me.
A cooperation plan was made.
I had made significant improvements and corrected a bug in the factory
optimization. I had difficulties to obey the six year's old request of P\"aivi Eskelinen to
wait patiently, so I tried
to get \textbf{J} published during my life time.
I told the leaders of Luke in March 2021 that I will not send improved codes
to Luke without an explicit co-operation agreement.
The research director Antti Asikainen answered
'According to my understanding the IPR rights of \textbf{J} software belong to Luke'.
The head of admininistration,
Ilkka P Laurila wrote: 'Luke has started preparations for the publication'.
Laurila was not on my e-mail list,
so evidently he answered on behalf of director general Johanna Buchert, who was.
After getting such a rejection to my co-operation offer, it was clear that
I would not send any codes to Luke. The highest leaders of Luke
did evidently not care of research needs of Hannu Salminen and others
included in the planned project.

I decided to continue my co-operation only with the GAYA group.
It had new interest
in co-operation as they were making a new simulator.



The situation changed when Lauri Meht\"atalo was invited to become a professor of Luke.
He started to mediate
negotiations between me and Luke. Earlier Luke did not acknowledge that I
did exist in legal sense in this matter. Lauri was able to persuade the
research director Asikainen to make an U-turn.
As some months earlier he did not see any co-operation with me possible,
he was now interested to become
a co-author in a forthcoming publication.
The negotiations started well, but finally I had to make an ultimatum to
brake conclusively all conncetions to Luke before
the co-operation agreement was signed 7.10. 2021 in the 100 years celebration of NFI in  Kings Hall
in the medieval Olavinlinna castle in Savonlinna.

I got a
permission to publish the software, and Luke agreed to
provide  treatment schedules simulated with Mela using NFI data from whole Finland and data
from pulp mills and saw mills.
Luke should provide me access to CSC supercomputers.  Luke should distribute \textbf{Jlp22} via Github.  This point
was not necessary as Reetta adviced me how to use Github.


During the hostile take over, the leaders knew nothing of the code
and the optimization algoritm,  and were not willing to learn these things. Packalen
Salminen and Korhonen had some idea what the software can do.
Thus the leaders did not know that
the code contained so much dirty code
that it could not be maintained and developed without my assistance.
For instance, the linear programming, the most important part of the software,
was coded into one 7000-line subroutine having 135 goto statements (do not tell anyone!).
The new factory optimization was very immature,
the data structures were too complicated, the algorithm was inefficient,
and import and export were not included.
The software was a 32-bit software with single precision data vectors. To allow
large optimization problems, the software must be
in 64-bit and in double precision.
Reetta could do some minor local maintenance work. But for
real improvements she should
start from clean table.
The code without my support
provided only slightly better perspectives than a one-time exe- file.
Anyhow, it would be interesting to know how the leaders planned to publish
tens of thousand code and manual lines I had written indicating that they
had produced these lines.

Markku Siitonen, the developer of the Mela software, used to say
'You shall not steal more that you can carry'. The leaders were
stealing (legally as all big robberies are done) more than they could carry
as they did not understand that their capture contained a large amount of dirty,
heavy-to-carry code.


\subsection*{Rewriting the software}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Rewriting the software}

Open \textbf{Jlp22} was published 22.4.2022 in a web-seminar, and it has been distributed in Github since then.
It contained many errors, but I wanted to get it out of the control of Luke as soon as possible.
After my retirement I have rewritten completely the software,
the most part after the agreement in 7.10.2021.
Only the sceleton and innermost loops in the optimization come from the time I worked
for Metla and Luke. The following manual tells what \textbf{Jlp22} can do now.
The factory optmization is under development, and I will be published it later.
Reetta has participated
in testing, in addition to teaching the use of Github.

\section{Recent changes}
\label{changes}

After renaming the software to \textbf{Jlp22}, this chapter starts to describe changes in new versions.
The corrections of errors are not described in detail. The first version of \textbf{Jlp22} contains so many new properties that also old users
should look at the manual. All the examples of the manual should now go through using ALL in running
jexamples.inc.

I (in this manual 'I' refers to the first author) found recently a bug in Fletchers code. When after some pivot steps only residual variables
are in the basis, the code computed wrong shadow prices, and the objective was getting worse.
This situation will not happen in ordinary linear programming problems. When hunting the bug, I developed new
debugging tools, so I hope that all users would now send problematic
runs to me.
\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
\textbf{Jlp22} can be used as is, i.e. using exe files. The User guide concentrates
on using binary files, but some reference is also made to additional possibilities offered
by the open \textbf{Jlp22} code.
\subsection{Using \textbf{Jlp22} exe files}
\label{intro1}
\textbf{Jlp22} is a general program for many different tasks. In one end, \textbf{Jlp22} is a programming language which
can be used to program several kind of applications and tasks, starting from computing 1+1, either
at \textcolor{Red}{sit>} promt or inside a trasformation object.
In the other end, it contains many functions which
can do several tasks in statistics, plotting figures,
deterministic and stochastic simulation and linear optimization. Forest planning with factories
using \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlp}() function can take several hours.
The general \textbf{Jlp22} functions and \textbf{Jlp22} trasformations can be combined in many ways.

There are several alternatives for doing general mathematical and statistical
computations available in \textbf{Jlp22}, most prominent being R. For  users of R, the most interesting
functions in \textbf{Jlp22} are evidently the linear programming functions which utilize the the structure
of typical forest managment planning problems. The forest management planning can now
in principle be combined with factories. Just now a completely new version of factory optimization
is under development, and thus it is not usable. R users can do general data management in R and use
\textbf{Jlp22} only for linear programming. But after learning basics of \textbf{Jlp22}, it may be more
straightforward to do also data management in Jjlp22.

\textbf{Jlp22} can now be used for general matrix computations. I have included in \textbf{Jlp22} all matrix functions of
Matlab which I found useful in a consulting project. \textbf{Jlp22} uses Gnuplot for making figures.
It is straigtforward to extend these graphics functions. \textbf{Jlp22} can be used an
interface to Gnuplot graphics.  \textbf{Jlp22} contains many tools to deal with classified data.
\subsection{Developing own \textbf{Jlp22} functions in Fortran}
\label{intro2}
The user's of \textbf{Jlp22} can utilize the open source of \textbf{Jlp22} in principally two different ways.
Either the user can develop new versions of existing \textbf{Jlp22} functions or the user can can make new functions.
It both cases the user should make new developments using so called own functions, which can
be independently of the main \textbf{Jlp22} functions. When modifying an existing \textbf{Jlp22} function, the user should make a copy of the
function under a different name. Then the old and new versions
can exist simultaneously in the function
space of \textbf{J}. It is very easy to add new functions in \textbf{Jlp22} and even more easy to add new options.

When deloping a new methods in \textbf{Jlp22}, it is possible to first use the \textbf{Jlp22}
script language to make developments.
Then the user can make an own function where the method is written in Fortran to make the method faster.
When writing new methods in Fortran, the user can concentrate on essential parts of the method, and utilize
the standard data management services provided by \textbf{Jlp22}.
\section{ Installing \textbf{Jlp22} from Github}

\subsection{Loading the package}
\label{gitload}

The installation is here described from the viewpoint of an user
who just want to use \textbf{Jlp22}, not develop it (yet).

The load zip button loads file \textbf{Jlp22}-master.zip. Copy this file into a proper folder.
Let it be Jgit. Clicking the \textbf{Jlp22}-master.zip icon shows folder \textbf{Jlp22}-master in
7Zip (if this is installed). Clicking unpack 7zip unpacks it to the folder Jgit.
Too many folder levels are avoided, if everyhing in folder \textbf{Jlp22}-master
is copied directly in
folder Jgit.

The jlp22.exe is the debug version of \textbf{Jlp22} and \textbf{Jlp22}r is the release version.
The debug version should be
used still used to set up a project. When everythings seems to work, the user
can try the release version in production runs where the time is of some concern.
Let us assume that the working folder is jtest.
\section{Typographical conventions}
\label{typo}
In this manual function names are written in red, option names in blue, object types in
capital letters, object names within the text are written in this color: \textcolor{teal}{Object}. Coloring of objects
is not ready. Objects of a certain type are written using just the type. Thus
a DATA means a DATA object.
Names like \textcolor{teal}{ob1} are used as generic names for object and names like  \textcolor{teal}{var1}
are generic names for REAL variables. An object with a special type is written
using the first letter in upper case and others in the lower case. Thus Matrix is a
generic name for a MATRIX object.

For functions that return real values or matrices which can be
used directly in arithmetic or matrix operations,
the existence of output is not indicated.

\section{Subroutines from other sources}

\section{Using \textbf{Jlp22}, and Gnuplot and Rscript from \textbf{Jlp22}}
\label{start}
This section tells how to install \textbf{Jlp22}, Gnuplot and Rscript from \textbf{Jlp22}
so that the user can start
running the examples in file jexamples.inc.
\subsection{Installing \textbf{Jlp22}, Gnuplot and Rscript}
\label{install}
After loading \textbf{Jlp22} from the Github, the folders of the exe files must be
put into the environmental variable PATH. In my computer the PATH contains line C:\textbackslash jlp22
An ordinary user may use \textbf{Jlp22} ans \textbf{Jlp22}r from the folder
Jgit\textbackslash \textbf{Jlp22}bin.

Let us then install Gnuplot. Go to page gnuplot.info, and select there download,
and in the download page select green 'download latest version', which loads
'gp543-min64-mingw.exe' (or similar), and if you let it install with usual yes-next procedures
gnuplot is installed  in folder c:\textbackslash program files\textbackslash gnuplot
which should be placed into the environmental variable Path.

When adding new lines to the path, it is necessary to accept changes with two 'OK'.
After editing PATH have effect only after restarting the computer.


If you plan to run R scripts from \textbf{Jlp22}, Rscript program mus be installed
and the folder must be put into the PATH. In my computer the folder is
C:\textbackslash Program Files\textbackslash R\textbackslash R-4.1.2\textbackslash bin


\subsection{Running examples}
\label{runex}

If you plan to edit the example file, copy jexamples.inc and jlp22.pdf  from jdocdemo folder into the Jtest folder.
It is not wise to start
working in the Jdocdemo folder, because if you load a new version of \textbf{Jlp22} in a similar way into Jgit folder
and allow the computer replace existing folders with the same name,
you would loose the work done in Jgit folder.

Open the command prompt and move to the directory 'jtest' by 'cd' commands.
It is possible to use \textbf{Jlp22} also directly, but its necessary to use \textbf{Jlp22} through the command prompt
at this testing phase, because then, if \textbf{Jlp22} crashes, the error messages do not disappear.
In first time, you may want to change
the colors etc of the commant prompt (color may take effect only after
closing command prompt and reopening it). It may be reasonable to tick all editing
properties under the properties button of the command prompt.

If you would like that when starting \textbf{Jlp22} in this folder, \textbf{Jlp22} immediately starts with examples,
make file j.par to folder jtest and write
to it

\textcolor{Red}{;incl}(jexamples.inc)

It is possible to write to the first line of j.par

*3000

which would mean that \textbf{Jlp22} would generate intially 3000 named objects.


Then start \textbf{Jlp22} by giving command \textbf{Jlp22} at the command prompt.
If you have not done j.par file, write at the \textcolor{Red}{sit>} prompt:  \textcolor{Red}{;incl}(jexamples.inc).
Alternatively you can diretly start in the jexamples.inc by launching \textbf{Jlp22} by\\
\textbf{Jlp22} jexamples.inc

\textbf{Jlp22} will then print all shortcuts available. You can run examples one by one by giving example shortcuts
individually, or you can run all examples by shortcut ALL. If you give shortcut ALL, \textbf{Jlp22} asks whether
a \textcolor{Red}{;pause} is generated after each example ('pause after each example(1/0)>').
Even if \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() is not generated after each example, it is generated after each plot.
This can be prevented by pressing <return> when \textbf{Jlp22} asks value for fpause. Examples in the ALL section can anyhow be started
at any point by putting label ';current:' to any point after label ;ALL: and giving shortcut
'current'. This is also handy when examples have errors which break the execution. If the errors are made
intentionally to demonstrate error situations, the interruption of excution after these intentional errors are
prevented so that the jexamples.inc have command Continue=1 before the intentional error. Theafter the normal
error handling is put on by command Continue=0.

It is useful to keep the manual open and follow simultaneously the manual and the execution of examples.



\section{Command input and output}
\label{cominout}
\textbf{Jlp22} has two programming levels. First level, called input programming, generates text lines which are then
transmitted to the parser which generates code which is the put into transformations sets or
excuted directly. Input programming loops make it possible to generate large number of command lines
in a compact and short form. This chapter describes input programming concepts and commands.
\subsection{Input record and input line}
\label{inpuline}
\textbf{Jlp22} reads input records from the current input channel which may be terminal, file or a text object.
When \textbf{Jlp22} interprets input lines, spaces between limiters and function or object names are not
significant. In input programming, functions start with ';' which is part of the function name (and
there can thus be no space immediately after ';'). If a line (record) ends with ',' ,'+', '*´, '-',
'(', '=' or with '>', then the next record is interpreted as a continuation record and
the continuation character is kept as a part of the input
line. Tf a record ends with ',' and the next record starts also with ',', only one ',' is obtained. If a line ends with '>{}>', then
the nex line is also continuation line, and  '>{}>' is ignored. All continuation
records together form one input line. In previous version input programming functions operated on input lines
but now they operate on recors. One input record can contain 4096 characters, and an input line can contain also 4096 characters
(this can be increased if needed).
There can be comment lines within a command line.

When entering input lines from the keyboard, the previous lines given from the keyboard can no more be
accessed and edited using the arrow keys owing to MSYS2 MSYS environment used to build the exe-file.
To copy text from the \textbf{Jlp22} window into the clipboard right-click the upper left icon, select Edit,
and then select Mark. Next click and drag the cursor to select the text you want to copy and
finally press Enter (or right-click the title bar, select Edit, and in the context menu click Copy).
To paste text from the clipboard into the \textbf{Jlp22} command line right-click the title bar, select Edit,
and in the context menu click Paste. Console applications of Intel Fortran do not provide copy
and paste using <cntrl>c and <cntrl>v. An annoying feature of the current command window is that it is possible
All input lines starting with '*' will be comments, and in each line text starting with '!' will also
be interpreted as comment (!debug will put a debugging mode on for interpretation of the
line, but this debug information can be understood only by the author). If a comment line starts
with '*!', it will be printed.
\subsection{Input Paragraph}
\label{inpupara}
Many \textbf{Jlp22} functions parsed and executed (interpreted) at the command level need or can use a group of
text lines as input. In these cases the additional input lines are immediately after the function.
This group of lines is called input paragraph. The input paragraph ends with '/', except the
input paragraph of text function ends with '//' as a text object can contain ordinary input
paragraphs. It may be default for the function that there is input paragraph following. When
it is not a default, then the existence of the input paragraph is indicated with option \textcolor{blue}{in->}
without any value. An input paragraph can contain input programming commands; the
resulting text lines are transmitted to the \textbf{Jlp22} function which interprets the input paragraph
\begin{example}[inpuparag]Example of inputparagraph\\
\label{inpuparag}
transa=\textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}()\\
a=\textcolor{VioletRed}{log}(b)\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{write}(\$,'($\sim$sinlog is=$\sim$,f4.0)',\textcolor{VioletRed}{sin}(a))\\
/\\
b=\textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}(2,3,\textcolor{blue}{in->})\\
1,2,3\\
5,6,7\\
/
\end{example}
\subsection{Shortcuts}
\label{short}
Command shortcuts are defined by defining character variables. When entering the
name of a character variable at \textcolor{Red}{sit>} prompt or from an include file, \textbf{Jlp22} excutes the command.
The command can be either input programming command or ??? command. The file jexamples.inc
shows an useful way to organize shortcuts and include files.
\begin{example}[shortex]Example of using shortcuts and include files\\
\label{shortex}
short1='\textcolor{VioletRed}{sin}(Pi)+\textcolor{VioletRed}{cos}(Pi);'\\
short1\\
te=\textcolor{VioletRed}{text}()\\
this=\textcolor{VioletRed}{thisfile}()\\
ju1='\textcolor{Red}{;incl}(this,\textcolor{blue}{from->}a1)'\\
ju2='\textcolor{Red}{;incl}(this,\textcolor{blue}{from->}a2)'\\
\textcolor{Red}{;return}\\
;a1:\\
\textcolor{Red}{;return}\\
;a2:\\
** here, jump to a1\\
ju1\\
*! back here, return to \textcolor{Red}{sit>} or next example in ALL\\
\textcolor{Red}{;return}\\
//\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{write}('shortex.txt',\$,te)\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{close}('shortex.txt')\\
\textcolor{Red}{;incl}(shortex.txt)\\
ju1\\
ju2\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{delete\_f}('shortex.txt')\\
te=0 !delete also text object te
\end{example}
\subsection{Input programming}
\label{inpuprog}
The purpose of the input programming is to read or generate \textbf{Jlp22} commands or input lines
needed by \textbf{Jlp22} functions. The names of input programming commands start with semicolon ';'.
There can be no space between ';' and the following input programming function. The syntax
of input programming commands is the same as in \textbf{Jlp22} functions, but the input programming
functions cannot have an output. There are also controls structures in the input programming.
An input paragraph can contain input programming structures.
\subsection{ Labels in input programming}
\label{inpuad}

The included text files can contain labels. Labels define possible starting points for the
inclusion or jump labels within an include file. A label starts with semicolon (;) and
ends with colon (:). There can be text after the label and the text is printed but
otherwise ignored.\\


;ad1:  At this point we are doing thit and that


\begin{note}
The definition of a transformations object can also contain labels. These labels start
with a letter and end also with colon (:). When defining a transformation object with \textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}() function,
the input paragraph can contain input programming addresses and code labels. It is up to
input programming what code alabels become part of the transformation object.
\end{note}


\subsection{Changing "i" sequences}
\label{inpureplace}
If an original input line contains text within quotation marks, then the sequence will be replaced
as follows. If a character variable is enclosed, then the value of the character variable is
substituted: E.g.
directory='D: \textbackslash j/\'
name='area1'
extension='svs'
then
\textcolor{blue}{in->}'"directory""name"."extension"'
is equivalent to
\textcolor{blue}{in->}'D: \textbackslash j \textbackslash area1.svs'
If the "-expression is not a character variable then \textbf{Jlp22} interprets the sequence as an arithmetic
expression and computes its value. Then the value is converted to character string and
substituted into the place. E.g. if nper is variable having value 10, then lines
\color{Green}
\begin{verbatim}
x\#"nper+1"\#"nper" = 56
chv = 'code"nper"'
\end{verbatim}
\color{Black}
are translated into
\color{Green}
\begin{verbatim}
x\#11\#10 = 56
chv = 'code10'
\end{verbatim}
\color{Black}

With " " substitution one can define general macros which will get specific interpretation by
giving values for character and numeric parameters, and numeric parameters can be utilized in
variable names or other character strings. In transformation sets one can shorten computation
time by calculating values of expressions in the interpretation time instead of doing
computations repeatedly. E.g. if there is in a data set transformation
x3 = "\textcolor{VioletRed}{sin}(Pi/4)"*x5
Then evaluation of \textcolor{VioletRed}{sin}(Pi/4) is done immediately, and the value is transmitted to the
transformation set as a real constant.
If value of the expression within a “” sequence is an integer then the value is dropped in the
place without the decimal point and without any spaces, otherwise its value is presented in
form which is dependent on magnitude of the value. After J3.0 the format can be explicitly
specified within [] before the numeric value. Eg. text can be put into a figure as
fig =
\textcolor{VioletRed}{drawline}(5,5,\textcolor{blue}{mark->}’y=”[f5.2]coef(reg,x1)“*x1+”[f5.2]coef(reg,1)“‘)
See file jex.txt and Chapter 8 for an ex
\subsection{\textcolor{Red}{;incl}() lines from a file}\index{;incl}

input programming function ;isum(). The syntax of the function is as follows:\\
\textcolor{Red}{;sum}(i,low,up,step)(text)\\
or \\
\textcolor{Red}{;sum}(i,low,up)\\
Arguments low, up and step must be integers (actually from nonintger values, the
integer part is used) or REAL variables. Thus te valuse cannot be obtained
from arithmetic operations. Sum is useful at least in \textcolor{VioletRed}{problem}() function.
\begin{example}[inpusumex]Example of \textcolor{Red}{;sum}()\\

prob=\textcolor{VioletRed}{problem}()\\
\textcolor{Red}{;sum}(i,1,5)(a"i"*x"i")==max\\

\textcolor{Red}{;dif}()() works similarly for minus
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{Red}{;dif}() differences into input}\index{;dif}
\label{inpudif}
\textbf{Jlp22} can generate text of form part1-part2-...partn into input line using
input programming function \textcolor{Red}{;dif}(). The syntax of the function is as follows:\\
\textcolor{Red}{;dif}(i,low,up,step)(text)\\
or \\
\textcolor{Red}{;dif}(i,low,up)\\
Arguments low, up and step must be integers (actually from nonintger values, the
integer part is used) or REAL variables. Thus te valuse cannot be obtained
from arithmetic operations. \textcolor{Red}{;dif}() is useful at least in \textcolor{VioletRed}{problem}() function.

\begin{note}
\textcolor{Red}{;sum}()() works similarly for plus. See \textcolor{Red}{;sum}() for examples.
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{Red}{;pause} in script processing}\index{;pause}
\label{inpupause}
Including input from an include file can be interrupted using an input programming
command \textcolor{Red}{;pause} promt or the \textbf{Jlp22} function \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}('<prompt>'). In both cases
the user can give \textbf{Jlp22} commands, e.g., print objects, change the value of Printdebug etc.
The difference is that  \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}('<prompt>') goes first through the interpreted and the interptreted
code is transmitted to the \textbf{Jlp22} function driver. In the \textcolor{Red}{;pause}- pause it is possible to
use input programming commands while in \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}()- pause it is not possible. In both cases, when
an error occurs, the control remains at the pause prompt. If the user is pressing
<return> \textbf{Jlp22} continues in the include file. If \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() is part of a transformation object,
pressing <return>, the function driver continues in the transformation object.
If the user gives command 'e' or 'end', then \textbf{Jlp22} procees similarly as if an error had occured,
i.e. print error messages and returns control to \textcolor{Red}{sit>} -promt.
\subsection{\textcolor{Red}{;return} from \textcolor{Red}{;incl}}\index{;return;incl}
\label{inpureturn}
\textcolor{Red}{;return} in an input file means that the control returns to the point where a
jumpt to an label was found. Two different cases need to be separated:
\begin{itemize}
\item The conrol came to the starting address or to the beginning of the include file
from outside the current include file using a \textcolor{Red}{;incl} command. Then \textcolor{Red}{;return} returns the control to upper level include
file or to the \textcolor{Red}{sit>} prompt.
\item The control came to the starting label from within the same include file using
an explicit \textcolor{Red}{;incl} or \textcolor{Red}{;incl} is generated
with command shortcut.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Access using part of the name}
\label{inpusubobj}
The subobjects generated with a function can be seen according
to the following example. The second example shows how objects having a common part in the
name can be printed.
\begin{example}[subobjex]Seeing subobjects\\
\label{subobjex}
dat=\textcolor{VioletRed}{data}(\textcolor{blue}{in->},\textcolor{blue}{read->}(x,y))\\

@subob;  ! prints the subobjects
\end{example}
\begin{example}[relativesex]Seeing relatives\\

\subsection{@List(index) Gets a name from a LIST}
\label{inpulistelem}
The name of an object in a LIST can be obtained into the input using the following example.
\begin{example}[inpulistelem]Getting name from list\\
\label{inpulistelem}
lis=\textcolor{VioletRed}{list}(c2...c5);\\
@lis=2...5;\\
@lis(2)=6;\\
@lis(4)=@lis(1);\\
@lis(2)\%@lis(4)=66;
\end{example}
\subsection{@List expands a LIST}
\label{expand}
If a LIST is generated explicitly with \textcolor{VioletRed}{list}() function or as a byproduct of an other function,
then all elements of the list can put into the code using @-sign in the front of the name of the list.
The code then works similarly as if all the object names had been written consecutively and separated
with commas.
\begin{note}
A function or an option can have several parts in the arguments generated with @
\end{note}
\begin{note}
In the earlier versions of the software,expanding lists with @ was implemented during the generation of
the input line similarly as in the input programming proper. This was stupid. It is more simple and more efficient to
to implement the expanding of lists during the code parsing stage. This is presented here because, @-sign works
as if it were part of input programming.
\end{note}
\begin{example}[expandex]Example of expanding lists with @\\
\label{expandex}
list0=\textcolor{VioletRed}{list}(site,altitude)\\
list1=\textcolor{VioletRed}{list}(\\
\textcolor{Red}{;do}(i,1,3)\\

2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\\
/\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{stat}()
\end{example}

\subsection{...  sequences}
\label{dots}
It is often natural to index object names, and often we need to refer object
names having consecutive index numbers or index letters. In \textbf{Jlp22} versions before version 3.0 it
was possible to generate object lists using ... -construct which replaced part of
the input line with the names of objects being between the the object
name before ... and after ... . Now the dots construct is no more done as
part of the input programming but in the interpret subroutine which interprets the
input line and generates the integer vector for function and argument indices.
But as dots work as if it would be part of the input programming, it is presented in this
section. Currently also sequences of integer constants can be generated with dots and
sequences can be from larger to smaller.
\begin{example}[dotsex]Example of dots construct\\
\label{dotsex}
dat=\textcolor{VioletRed}{data}(\textcolor{blue}{read->}(x4...x7),\textcolor{blue}{in->})\\

\section{\textbf{Jlp22} objects}
\label{objintro}
\textbf{Jlp22} objects have a simple yet efficient structure. Each object is associatd with two integer vectors, one single precision vector, one double precision vector,
one vector of characters and one vector of text lines. All vectors are allocated dynamically.
There are several object types which store data differently in these vectors.
Object can be either simple or compound objects. Compound objects are linked to other
objects which can be used also directly utilizing the standard naming conventions. All objects are
global, i.e. also users can acces all objects. Some predefined objects are locked so that
users cannot change them.

There are three types of objects
\begin{itemize}
\item Named objects. The number of named objects is specified at the initilaization,
and it cannot be changed later. Deleting an object means deallocating all the allocated
vectors associated with the objects.
\item Temporary objects used to store intermediate results.
\item Temporary objects used to store the partial derivatives when computing the derivatives using
the derivations rules.
\end{itemize}

Alongside the objects there is a vector of double precision values, call j\_v-vector. When an object is called a REAL
object or variable, this vector is referenced. After the parts corresponding to named objects and
those two sets of temporary objects, there is an area used to store numeric constants. If a REAL
variable a has object number of 100 and constan 7 is in the  position 7000 in the v-vector,
then a+7 can be presented as j\_v(100)+j\_v(7000). Thus after parsing, all arithmetic computations can be done wihtou reference to whether
a variable is in the named part or constant part of the j\_v-vector.
Because the numeric contants are at the end section of the j\_v-vector,
new space can be added for the numeric
constants without mixing up parsed transformations.
\subsection{Object names}
\label{onames}
Object names start with letter or with {\$\#}. Object names can contain any of
symbols {\#\%§ \textbackslash \_} \textbf{Jlp22} is using '\%' to name objects related to some other objects.
E.g. function \textcolor{VioletRed}{stat}(x1,x2,\textcolor{blue}{mean->}) will store means of variables x1 and x2 into
variables x1\%mean and x2\%mean. Objects with name starting with '\$' are not
stored in the automatically created lists of input and output variables when
defining transformation objects. The variable Result which
is the output variable, if no output is given, is not put into these lists.
Object names can contain special characters (e.g. +-*=()) if these are closed
within ‘[‘ and ‘]’, e.g. a[2+3]. This possibility to include additional information
is borrowed from Markku Siitonen, the developer of Mela software.
If an transformation object is created with \textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}() function, and the
intended global arguments are given in the list of arguments,
then a  local object {ob} created e.g. with transformation object {tr} have prefix
{tr \textbackslash } yelding {tr \textbackslash ob}. Actually also these objects are global, but their prefix
protects them so that they do not intervene with objects having the same name in the
calling transformation object.
There are many objects intialized automatically.
Some of these are locked so that the users cannot change them. In transformation objects
there can be objects which are intended to be used only locally. These are protected
by putting an unvisible prefix to the object names, but these can be anyhow accessed
by writing the the prefix.
Names of objects having a predefined interpretation start with capital letter.
The user can freely use lower or upper case letters. \textbf{Jlp22} is case sensitive.
All objects known at a given point of a \textbf{Jlp22} session can be listed by command:
\textcolor{VioletRed}{print}(Names)
\subsection{Object types}
\label{otypes}
The following description describes shortly different object types available in
\textbf{J}. More detailed descriptions are given in connection of \textbf{Jlp22} functions which
create the objects and in Developers' guide.
\subsubsection{Real variables and constants}
\label{realo}
A REAL variable is a named object associated with a single
double precision value. Before version J3.0 the values were in single
precision, and thus this objecttype is still called REAL.
The
value can be directly defined at the command level, or the variable can get
the value from data structures.  E.g.
\textcolor{VioletRed}{stat}(D,H,\textcolor{blue}{min->},\textcolor{blue}{max->}) ! Here arguments must be variable names
a = \textcolor{VioletRed}{sin}(2.4) ! argument is in radians \textcolor{VioletRed}{sind}() is for degrees
h = \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}(\textcolor{blue}{read->}(x1...x4))   ! x1, x2 ,x3, x4 are variables in the data set, and
get their values when doing operations for the data.


\begin{note}
All objects have also an associated REAL value. In order to make
arithmetic operations fast, the argument types in simple arithmetic functions
are not checked. If a general object is used as an argument in an arithmetic
operation, then the REAL value associated with the object is used. This will
usually prevent the program to stop due to Fortran errors, but will produce
unintended results.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
In this manual 'variable' refers to a \textbf{Jlp22} object whose type is REAL.
\end{note}
\subsubsection{Character constants and variables}
\label{charo}
Character constants are generated by closing text within apostrophe signs ( '
). Apostrophe character ( ' ) within a character constant is indicated with ($\sim$)
(if the character $\sim$ is not present in the keyboard, it can be produced by <Alt
>126, where numbers are entered from the numeric keyboard) Character constants are used e.g.  in I/O functions for file names, formats
and to define text to be written.  , e.g
a = \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}(\textcolor{blue}{in->}'file1.dat', \textcolor{blue}{read->}(x1,x2)) &

\textcolor{VioletRed}{write}('output.txt', '($\sim$kukkuu=$\sim$,4f7.0)', \textcolor{VioletRed}{sqrt}(a)) &
Character variables are pointers to character constants. An example of a
character variable definition:


cvar='file1.dat' &
After defining a character variable, it can be used exactly as the character
constants.
\begin{note}
The quotation mark (") has special meaning in the input programming. See
Input programming how to use character constants within character constants.
\end{note}
\subsubsection{Logical values}
\label{logical0}
There is no special object type for logical variables. Results of logical
operations are stored into temporary or named real variables so that 0 means
False and 1 means True. In logical tests all non-zero values will mean True.
Thus e.g. \textcolor{VioletRed}{if}(6)b=7 is legal statement, and variable b will get value 7. E.g.
\textcolor{Red}{sit>}h=a.lt.b.and.b.le.8 &
\textcolor{Red}{sit>}\textcolor{VioletRed}{print}(h) &
h=   1.00000 &

\section{\textbf{Jlp22} functions}
\label{jfuncs0}
The structure of \textbf{Jlp22} functions is easiest to explain using an example.
For instance a data object can be created with \\
data2=\textcolor{VioletRed}{newdata}(matrx,matrz,\textcolor{blue}{read->}(x1...x3,z1...z4),\textcolor{blue}{maketrans->}mt) \\
Here \textcolor{teal}{data2} is the output, \textcolor{teal}{matrx} and \textcolor{teal}{matrz} are matrices having equal number of rows. Matrix
\textcolor{teal}{matrx} has 3 columns, \textcolor{teal}{matrz} 4. \textcolor{blue}{read->} is an option which tells
what are the variable names in the data. x1...x3 is equivalent to x1,x2,x3.  Option
\textcolor{blue}{maketrans->}mt tells that for each observation the trasformations defined in the trasformation
object \textcolor{teal}{mt} are computed from variables x1...x3 and z1...z4. The output variables
whose names do not start with \$ are included in the DATA object.


A function call obtained from the  input programming can have the
following components separed with commas.
\subsection{Output of a function}
\label{output}

There are the the following cases with respect to
the output of the function

\begin{itemize}

\item The function appears in a code line looking like\\
Output=func()\\
Then the function produces an object \textcolor{teal}{Output}. The type of the \textcolor{teal}{Output} depends on the function.
Several functions produce additional objects whose name start with ]Output\%[. The
object \textcolor{teal}{Output} may or may not store links to these object. If such links are
stored then the output is a compound object. An objects to which there is a link, is called a subobject.
Objects without such links are called side objects. For instance linear programming function \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlp}()
does not produce any object with name \textcolor{teal}{Output} just several side objects.

\item The expression \\
func()\\
is equivalent to\\
Result=func()
\item If code line is Output=func(); or func(); the Output or Result are printed if
variable Printvalue has value 1 or 3.  If code line is Output=func();; or func();;
if variable Printvalue has value 2 or 3.

\item Output is a temporal object. If a function is part of arithmetic computations, then
the intermediate results are stored into temporary objects according to the parse tree. Thus in the
expression y=\textcolor{VioletRed}{sin}(x)+\textcolor{VioletRed}{cos}(x), \textcolor{VioletRed}{sin}(x) produses first a temporary object and \textcolor{VioletRed}{cos}(x)
another temporary object.
\item Output is a submatrix of a MATRIX object. If A is a 4x4 matrix, and
B is a3x3 MATRIX,then expression\\
A(2,-4,1,-3)=B\\
puts MATRIX B into A.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Function names}
\label{functionname}

Function name can be be any of the four cases.
\begin{itemize}

\item A standard \textbf{Jlp22} function,
\item An arithmetic or logical function obtained when translating the code into the polish notation.nslated first into
Thus \\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{if}(region.eq.savo)c=2*3+4;\\
is translated into \\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{if}(\textcolor{VioletRed}{EQ}(region,savo))c=\textcolor{VioletRed}{PLUS}(\textcolor{VioletRed}{MULT}(2,3),4);\\
The user can try directly the above translated form
\item An own-function of the user included in the function space.

\item Implicit function generated with the parser. For instance, options are implemented using
\textcolor{VioletRed}{setoption}() function.
\item \textbf{Jlp22} object which can be used as if it were a function. Currently there
are four such cases
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{MATRIX as a function}
\label{matrixfunc}
If matrixa is a MATRIX then expression matrixa() can be both in the input side or output side to indicate
a submatrix or element of the matrix. See matrix chapter.
\subsubsection{REAL as a MATRIX}
\label{realmatrix}
Often in matrix computations, a REAL is a limiting value of a sequence of matrices.
To facilitate such computations, matrixa(1) and matrixa(1,1) are legal ways to refer to matrixa even if it is REAL.
If matrixa is REAL, then expression matrixa(3) is causing error:\\
matrixa is REAL, ranges            5  are illegal, only (1) or (1,1) are allowed
\subsubsection{DATA as a function}
\label{datafunc}
If Data is  DATA then Data(var1,..,varn) indicates a matrix obtained by picking
the columns of the data matrix corresponding the argument variables.
\subsubsection{Using a transformation object as a function}
\label{transfunc}
It is now possible to use a transformation object as a function which computes new
objects when generating arguments for functions or options,
or values of code options, or in any place within a transformation object.
If {tr} is a transformation and the transformation computes an object {A} then
{tr(A)} is first calling transformation {tr} and provides then object {A} into this place.
As the transformation computes also other objects which are computed within it, also thes objects
are available. At this point it is important to note that arguments of
a transformation line are computed from right to left, because options must be computed before
entering into a function.
\begin{example}[transfunc]Transformation as a function\\
\label{transfunc}
\textcolor{VioletRed}{delete\_o}(a,c)\\
transa=\textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}()\\
a=8;\\
c=2;\\
/\\
transb=\textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}()\\
a=5;\\
c=1;\\
/\\
c=2\\
a=c+transb(a)+c+transa(a);
\end{example}
\subsubsection{REGR as a function}
\label{regrfunc}
If Regr is a regression object produced with regr, then Regr() produces
the value of the regression function as explained for \textcolor{VioletRed}{regr}(). The values of arguments
can be given in the calling code or the existing values can be used.
\subsubsection{Cannot produce -error}
\label{isnotfunc}
If the code looks like a function, the control goes to j\_getelem function
which computes the results for the above mentioned object types. But if
the object cannot produce anything, there will be an error message:\\
produce   but it is not a function or object which can provide something then
there will be an error message:\\
* (object name) cannot produce anything\\
But if the object is REAL then the error message can be \\
matrixa is REAL, ranges            5  are illegal, only (1) or (1,1) are allowed\\
because a REAL can be treated as a 1x1 MATRIX.
\subsection{Arguments of a function}
\label{arguments}
Arguments separated with commas. Arguments can be a combination of the following types
\begin{itemize}
\item object name
\item numeric constant
\item A code which produces a temporary object generated with any \textbf{Jlp22} functions
\item a sequence of object names generated with ... as x1...x3 above.
\item @List where \textcolor{teal}{List} is a LIST. If \textcolor{teal}{List} is obtainedwit \textcolor{teal}{List}=\textcolor{VioletRed}{list}(x1...x3), then
@List is equivalent to x1...x3 which is equivalnet to x1,x2,x3.
\end{itemize}
a = \textcolor{VioletRed}{sin}(\textcolor{VioletRed}{cos}(c)+b) ! Usual arithmetic functions have numeric values as arguments.
here the value of the argument of cos is obtained by 'computing' the
value of real variable c.
\textcolor{VioletRed}{stat}(D,H,\textcolor{blue}{min->},\textcolor{blue}{max->}) ! Here arguments must be variable names
\textcolor{VioletRed}{plotyx}(H,D,\textcolor{blue}{xrange->}(\textcolor{VioletRed}{int}(D\%min,5), \textcolor{VioletRed}{ceiling}(D\%max,5))) !arguments of the function are variables, arguments of option \textcolor{blue}{xrange->} are numeric values
c = \textcolor{VioletRed}{inverse}(h+\textcolor{VioletRed}{t}(g)) ! The argument can be intermediate result from matrix computations.
If it is evident if a function or option should have object names or values as their arguments, it
is not indicated with a special notation. If the difference is emphasized, then the values are
indicated by val1,...,valn, and objects by obj1,...,objn, or the names of real variables are
indicated by var1,...,varn.
There are some special options which do not refer to object names or values. Some options
define a small one-statement transformation to be used to compute something repeatedly.

\subsection{Options of a function}
\label{options}
Options give additional arguments to the function.
\subsubsection{Option structure}
\label{optionstructure}
An option starts with the option name
followed with '->' after which there can be
\begin{itemize}
\item Nothing. In this case the option indicated that the option is put 'on'. E.g.
\textcolor{blue}{continue->} in a graphics function indicates that no \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() is generated after plotting the figure.
\item Numeric value, e.g. \textcolor{blue}{continue->}\textcolor{teal}{fcont} in a graphics function
indicates that no \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() is generated if a REAL object \textcolor{teal}{fcont} has a nonzero value.

\item Object name.
\item Function name followed by the arguments within parenthesis, e.g.,
\textcolor{blue}{xrange->}(0,\textcolor{VioletRed}{ask}('xmax')) where \textcolor{VioletRed}{ask}() is the function which asks a numeric value from the user.
\item Arguments of the option expressed in the same way as the arguments of the function, i.e.,
using acode which is producing a temporary object.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Codeoptions}
\label{codeoption}
Options are grouped into two groups: code options and regular options.
Code options
define a small one-statement transformation to be used to compute something repeatedly.
As these one-statement can use transformation objects as functions, the code option can actually
execute long computations. For instance \\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{stat}(D,H,\textcolor{blue}{filter->}(region.eq.savo)) \\
only those observations are accepted which pass the filter.\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{draw}(\textcolor{blue}{func->}(\textcolor{VioletRed}{sin}(\$x)+1),\textcolor{blue}{x->}\$x,\textcolor{blue}{xrange->}(0,10,1),\textcolor{blue}{continue->}fcont)\\
\textcolor{blue}{func->} option
transmits the function to be drawn not a single value.
\section{Arithmetic and logical functions and operations}
\label{arith}
Jlp has all the standard arithmetic and logical opertaions and functions.
The arithmetic and logical functions return single REAL value or a MATRIX.
\subsection{Functions \textcolor{VioletRed}{sqrt}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{sqrt2}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{exp}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{log}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{log10}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{abs}()}\index{sqrt()sqrt2()exp()log()log10()abs()}
\label{arfu1}
!
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{sqrt}(x) square root, \textcolor{VioletRed}{sqrt}(0) is defined to be 0, negative argument produce error.
If {x} is matrix, then an error occurs if any elemet is negative.
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{sqrt2}(x) If {x} or an element of {x} is negative then \$\textcolor{VioletRed}{sqrt2}()=-\textcolor{VioletRed}{sqrt}()\$. Actually \textcolor{VioletRed}{sqrt2}() might be a
useful sigmoidal function in modeling context.
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{exp}(x) \$e\$ to power {x}. If {x}>88, then \textbf{Jlp22} produces error in order to avoid system
crash.
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{log}(x) natural logarithm
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{log10}(x) base 10 logarithm
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{abs}(x) absolute value
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Conversion to integer}
\label{conversion}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{nint}(x) nearest integer value
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{nint}(x,modulo) returns modulo*nint(x/modulo) ,e.g.\textcolor{VioletRed}{nint}(48,5)=50; \textcolor{VioletRed}{nint}(47,5)=45;
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{int}(x) integer value obtained by truncation
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{int}(x,modulo) returns modulo*int(x/modulo), e.g. \textcolor{VioletRed}{int}(48,5)=45
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{ceiling}(x) smallest integer greater than or equal to {x}.
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{ceiling}(x,modulo) returns modulo*ceiling(x/modulo), e.g. \textcolor{VioletRed}{ceiling}(47,5)=50.
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{floor}(x) greatest integer smaller than or equal to {x}.
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{floor}(x,modulo) returns modulo*floor(x/modulo), e.g. \textcolor{VioletRed}{floor}(47,5)=45.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{min}() and \textcolor{VioletRed}{max}()}\index{min()max()}
\label{minmax}
Functions \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}() and max ()
behave in a special way, \textcolor{VioletRed}{max}() behaves similarly as \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}() here:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}(x1,x2):: minimum of two REAL
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}(MATRIX,REAL):: each element is \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}(elem,REAL)
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}(MATRIX):: row vector having minimums of all columns
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}(MATRIX,\textcolor{blue}{any->}):: minimum over the whole amtrix
\end{itemize}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{sign}(A,B)}
\label{sign}
\textcolor{VioletRed}{sign}(A,B) returns the value of A with the sign of B.
\subsection{Numeric operations}
\label{numer}
An arithmetic expression consisting of ordinary arithmetic operations is formed in
the standard way. The operations are in the order of their precedence.
\begin{itemize}
\item - unary minus
\item *** integer power
\item ** or \^ real power
\item * multiplication
\item / division
\item + addition
\item - subtraction
\end{itemize}

The reason for having a different integer power is that it is faster to compute and a negative
value can have an integer power but not a real power.

In matrix computations there are two additional opertations.

\begin{itemize}
\item *. elementwise product (Hadamard product)
\item /. elementwise division
\end{itemize}

The matrix operations are explained in section ?. Their operation rules extent
the standard rules.
\subsection{Logical and relational expressions}
\label{logic}
There are following relational and logical operations. The first alternatives
follow Fortan style:
\begin{itemize}
\item .eq. == equal to
\item .ne. <> not equal
\item .gt. > greater than
\item .ge. >= greater or equal
\item .lt. < less than
\item .le. <= less or equal
\item .not. $\sim$ negation
\item .and. & conjunction
\item .or. disjunction
\item .eqv. equivalent.
\item .neqv. not equivalent
\end{itemize}

The relational and logical expressions produce value 1 for True and value 0 for False.
Note: Testing equivalence can be done also using 'equal to' and 'not equal', as the same truth
value is expressed with the same numeric value.
\begin{note}
when the truth value of an expression is tested with \textcolor{VioletRed}{if}(), then all nonzero real values
means that the expression is true.
\end{note}


\section{Operation of \textbf{Jlp22}}
\label{joperation}
In this section the main structure of the operation of \textbf{Jlp22} and tools
in code development in a project are presented.
The two operation modes are interactive operation and batch operation.
\subsection{Looping between j\_getinput, j\_parser and dotrans}
\label{basicloop}
The are three key subroutines in \textbf{Jlp22} operation.
\begin{itemize}
\item j\_getinput gets a new command line from the console, an include file. j\_getinput can
read several records to make one command line, and it can edit or duplicate the input
with special \textbf{input programming} tools. Jlp prints \textcolor{Red}{sit>} prompt
when reading form the console. Input programming lines are indicated with initila \%.
\item If the obtained input line is not an input programming command or if it is not
captured by some function which is utilizing j\_getinput, the line goes to j\_parser which
generates an integer vector.
\item The integer vector produced by the j\_parser is interpred ('executed' in this manual)
with dotrans subroutine.
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}() function packs several lines generated in j\_getinput - j \_parser loops
into a tranformation (TRANS) object, which can be called from different functions.
\item dotrans subroutine executes a single line command which is not part of an TRANS object.
\textbf{Jlp22} writes '\#' in te front of the line.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Printing of \textbf{Jlp22}}
\label{printing}
\textbf{Jlp22} prints information of the proceeding of the control. There are different ways to control
the output. Finetuning is needed in the output. There are three logical
stages in the flow of the control. The output indicates these as follows.
\subsubsection{\% -lines are printed from input programming}
\label{printinpu}
The input programming lines are printed starting with \%.
The amount of printing is controlled with \textcolor{teal}{Printinput} variable.
the dafault is Printinput=1. A problem in printing the input is how much should be
printed when many input lines are produced with \textcolor{Red}{;do}()
\subsubsection{\# -lines are printed in one-line commands.}
\label{printcommand}
The input lines which go directly to execution are printed starting with \#.
\subsubsection{\textcolor{teal}{Printoutput} guides printing of functions.}
\label{printoutput}
The amount of printing in functions is guided with with variable [Printoutput[.
The default is \\
[Printoutput[=2\\
Several functions have \textcolor{blue}{print->} option which overrules \textcolor{teal}{Printoutput}
The number of printed lines when printing MATRIX,TEXT, or TXT is controlled with
variable \textcolor{teal}{Maxlines}, which is overruled with maxlines option in some functions.
\subsection{Interactive operation}
\label{interactive}
In the interactive operation, \textbf{Jlp22} may first read commands from the
default \textcolor{Red}{;incl} -file or from the file specified when starting the software,e.g. using\\
\textbf{Jlp22} myincl.inc \\
or with the release version
\textbf{Jlp22}r myinc.inc\\
where myinc.inc is the file giving the initial commands. If command 'end' is read, then the program exites.
But after reading an \textcolor{Red}{;incl}-file to the end or up to \textcolor{Red}{;return}, or after encountering an error, the \textbf{Jlp22} starts
to read commands from the console using '\textcolor{Red}{sit>}' -prompt, where the user can give
operation commands or new \textcolor{Red}{;incl} -command or 'end'.

In the interactive operation, the processing of sripts can be interrupted with \textcolor{Red}{;pause}, and
execution of TRANS can be intterrupted with \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}(). Even if they are described in
'Command input and output' and '\textbf{Jlp22} transformations' chapters, descriptions
are repeated here as they are useful in the interactive operation of \textbf{Jlp22}.
\subsubsection{\textcolor{Red}{;pause} in script processing}\index{;pause}
\label{inpupause}
Including input from an include file can be interrupted using an input programming
command \textcolor{Red}{;pause} promt or the \textbf{Jlp22} function \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}('<prompt>'). In both cases
the user can give \textbf{Jlp22} commands, e.g., print objects, change the value of Printdebug etc.
The difference is that  \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}('<prompt>') goes first through the interpreted and the interptreted
code is transmitted to the \textbf{Jlp22} function driver. In the \textcolor{Red}{;pause}- pause it is possible to
use input programming commands while in \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}()- pause it is not possible. In both cases, when
an error occurs, the control remains at the pause prompt. If the user is pressing
<return> \textbf{Jlp22} continues in the include file. If \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() is part of a transformation object,
pressing <return>, the function driver continues in the transformation object.
If the user gives command 'e' or 'end', then \textbf{Jlp22} procees similarly as if an error had occured,
i.e. print error messages and returns control to \textcolor{Red}{sit>} -promt.
\subsubsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() in a TRANS or in command input}\index{pause()}
\label{pause}
Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() stops the execution of \textbf{Jlp22} commands which are either in an
include file or in TRANS object. The user can give any commands during the
\textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() except input programming commands.
If the user presses <return> the excution continues. If the user gives 'e', then
an error condition is generated, and \textbf{Jlp22} comes to the \textcolor{Red}{sit>} promt, except
if \textcolor{teal}{Continue} has values 1, in which case the control returns one level above
the \textcolor{Red}{sit>} promt.
If \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}()  has a CHAR argument, then that character constant is used as
the prompt.
\begin{note}
When reading commands from an include file, the a pause can be generated also
with \textcolor{Red}{;pause}, which works similarly as \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}(), but during \textcolor{Red}{;pause} also input programming
commands can be given.
\end{note}
\subsection{Batch mode}
\label{batch}
If the default main program is replaced with a program which tells that Jlp is operated
in the batch mode, or if the initial   \textcolor{Red}{;incl} -file containscommand \textcolor{VioletRed}{batch}(), the \textbf{Jlp22} is operated in
the batch mode. In the batch mode, the control never starts to read commands from the
console at \textcolor{Red}{sit>} prompt. Using \textbf{Jlp22} from R, developed with Lauri Meht\"atalo is using \textbf{Jlp22} in the batch mode.
\subsection{Using shortcuts and sections in \textcolor{Red}{;incl} files}\index{;incl}
\label{operation2}

It is useful to organize
the project sript into one script file, which conatians swections starting with a lable and ending
with \textcolor{Red}{;return}.
I think that it is more difficult to have several script files.
The example file jexamples.inc is a good example of a script file.
different versions of the same script file are stored in different names, it is useful to have
as first line something like
this=\textcolor{VioletRed}{thisfile}()\\
Then it is not necessary to change anything if the file is stored in a different name.
Thereafter comes the shortcut definitions for different sections.
the same
For instance, if the the section
label is \\
;thistask:\\
then the shortcut definition could be
thistaskh='\textcolor{Red}{;incl}(this,\textcolor{blue}{from->}thistask)'\\

The section should end with\\
\textcolor{Red}{;return}\\
After defining shortcuts for all sections, it is useful to have a shortcut as:\\
again=\textcolor{Red}{;incl}(this)\\
If new sections are added, then one needs to give just shortcut\\
again\\
and then the new shortcuts will be defined. It does not matter if the earlier shortcuts are redefined.

The last shortcut could be \\
current='\textcolor{Red}{;incl}(this,\textcolor{blue}{from->}current)
The label 'current' can be a floating label which is put into the section which is under developed
in place the problems started.

If a \textbf{Jlp22} code line, either in the input paragraph defining a transformation object
or outside it, ends with ';' or ';;', the the output object of the code line may be printed.
The output of ';'-line is printed if the variable \textcolor{teal}{Printoutput} has value 1 or 3 at the time when the the
code line is computed.
The output of ';;'-line is printed if the variable \textcolor{teal}{Printoutput} has value 2 or 3 at the time when the the
code line is computed.

If a code line within a tranformation has function \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}('text'), then a pause is generated during which
the user can give any commands except
input programming commands. If the user will press <return> then the exceution continues. If the user
presses 'e' and <return>, the control comes to the \textcolor{Red}{sit>} promt similarly as during an error.

If the line outside the transformation definition paragraph is '\textcolor{Red}{;pause}', then
a similar pause is generated except also input programming commands can be give.

If the variable \textcolor{teal}{Debugtrans} has value 1, them a \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() is genertated before each line within
a tranformation object is executed.  If variable \textcolor{teal}{Debugconsole} has value 1,
a '\textcolor{Red}{;pause}' is generated before  the line is excuted. In bot cases the user can
give new values for \textcolor{teal}{Debugtrans} and \textcolor{teal}{Debugconsole}.

What happens when an error is encountered is dependent on the value of variable \textcolor{teal}{Continue}. If \textcolor{teal}{Continue} has
value 0 (the default case), the control comes into \textcolor{Red}{sit>} prompt when an real error occurs or if an atrficial
error condition is generated with \textcolor{VioletRed}{errexit}(). If \textcolor{teal}{Continue} has value 1 then the computation continues in
the same script file where the error occured. This property is used in file jexaples.inc to demonstrate
possible error conditions so that the computation continues as if no error had occured.


\subsection{end ends \textbf{Jlp22}}
\label{exit}
To exit \textbf{Jlp22} program and close console window, just give end command:

\textcolor{Red}{sit>}end
\section{Functions for handling objects}
\label{objects}
The following functions can handle objects.
\subsection{	Copying object: a=b}
\label{copy}
A copy of object can be made by the assignment statement a=b.
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{type}() Type of an object or all available types}\index{type()}
\label{type}
The type of any object can be access by \textcolor{VioletRed}{type}(\textcolor{teal}{object}).
If the argument is a character variable or character constant referring to
a character constant, and there is \textcolor{blue}{content->} option, and the character is the name of
an object , the \textcolor{VioletRed}{type}() returns the type of the object having the name given in the argument.
If there is no object having that name, then \textcolor{VioletRed}{type}() returns -1 and no error is generated.
\begin{example}[typeex]Example of type\\
\label{typeex}
ttt=8;   !REAL\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{type}(ttt);\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{type}('ttt'); !type is CHAR\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{type}('ttt',\textcolor{blue}{content->});\\
cttt='ttt'\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{type}(cttt);\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{type}(cttt,\textcolor{blue}{content->});
\end{example}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{delete\_o}() Deletes objects}\index{delete\_o()}
\label{delete_o}
The function \textcolor{VioletRed}{delete\_o}() deletes all the argument objects, which means that the
associated allocated vectors are deallocated, and the object will be REAL.
\begin{note}
Note that \textcolor{VioletRed}{delete\_o}() is actually needed only for matrices, because objects
can be deleted with Object=0. When Object is a matrix, then Object=0 puts all elements
into zero.
\end{note}
\begin{example}[deleteoex]Delete object\\
\label{deleteoex}
a=\textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}(2,3,\textcolor{blue}{do->});\\
b=\textcolor{VioletRed}{t}(a);\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{delete\_o}(a,b)\\
a,b;
\end{example}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{exist\_o}(): does an object exist}\index{exist\_o()}
\label{existo}
looks whether an object with the name given in
the character constant  argument exists.
\begin{note}
In the previous versions of \textbf{Jlp22} same function was used for files and objects.
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{name}(): writes the name of an object}\index{name()}
\label{name}
The argument gives the index of the object. This function
may useful if \textbf{J} prints in problem cases the object indices.
\section{System requirement}
\label{system}
The current binary versions of \textbf{Jlp22} are developed using Gfortran Fortran 90 compiler in MSYS2 MINGW 64-bit environment
under Windows 10.
Binary versions are ordinary console applications. It is recommended that \textbf{Jlp22} is used in command
prompt window, so that
if execution of \textbf{Jlp22} terminates unexpectedly, the error debugging information, remains visible.
With the debug version the problematic line is indicated.
See chapter ? for more information of error handling.

See \textbf{Jlp22}.0 Development Guide to start develop the software or to add
own functions. The development package contains, in addition to source code for
the standard \textbf{Jlp22} software, program Jmanual
which can be used to generate Latex code for the manualand the the include file for
examples.   The precompiler Jpre  writes necessary Fortran statements to access all global
\textbf{Jlp22} data structures, makes indentations and checks if-the and do strutures and gives
better error messages for them than Gfortran.

Figures are made with Gnoplot.
Gnuplot is freely available at


https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/gnuplot/5.4.2/

Download  download gp542-win64-mingw.exe. This will install gnuplot on your windows
system under C::\textbackslash Program Files\gnuplot\. \textbf{Jlp22} will strat Gnuplot automatically when
plotting figures if Gnuplot is on the PATH (see section Installing Gnuplot and \textbf{Jlp22}).
Dcomentation is found also in \ref{gnu}

\section{\textbf{Jlp22} transformations}
\label{jtrans}
Most operation commands affecting \textbf{Jlp22} objects can be entered directly at the command level or
packed into transformation object. In both cases the syntax and working is the same. A
command line can define arithmetic operations for real variables or matrices, or they can
include functions which operate on other \textbf{Jlp22} objects. General \textbf{Jlp22} functions can have arithmetic
statements in their arguments or in the option values. In some cases the arguments must be
object names. In principle it is possible to combine several general \textbf{Jlp22} functions in the same
operation command line, but there may not be any useful applications yet, and possibly some
error conditions would be generated.
Definition: A numeric function is a \textbf{Jlp22} function which returns a single real value. These functions
can be used within other transformations similarly as ordinary arithmetic functions. E.g.
\textcolor{VioletRed}{weights}() is a numeric function returning the number of schedules having nonzero weight
in a JLP-solution. Then \textcolor{VioletRed}{print}(\textcolor{VioletRed}{sqrt}(\textcolor{VioletRed}{weights}())+Pi) is a legal transformation.
\subsection{Transformation object}
\label{transo}
A transformation object groups several operation commands together so that they
can be used for different purposes by \textbf{Jlp22} functions and \textbf{Jlp22} objects. A
transformation object contains the interpreted transformations. For more details
see \textbf{Jlp22} function for defining transformation objects: \textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}().
Transformation objects can be called using \textcolor{VioletRed}{call}() function, so that all
transformations defined in the object are done once. Function result() also calls
transformations but is also returning a value. When transformation objects are
linked to data objects, then the transformations defined in trans-formation object
are done separately for each observation.
There is an implicit transformation object \$Cursor\$ which is used to run the
command level. The name \$Cursor\$ may appear in error messages when doing
commands at command level.  An-other transformation object \$Val\$ which is used to
take care of the substitutions of "-sequences in the input programming. Some \textbf{Jlp22}
functions use also implicitly transformations object \$Cursor2\$.
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}() Creates a TRANS (transformation) object}\index{trans()}
\label{trans}
\textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}() function interprets lines from input paragraph following the \textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}() command and puts the
interpreted code into an integer vector, which can be excuted in several places.
If there are no arguments in the function, the all objected used within the
transforamations are global. This may cause conflicts if there are several recursive
functions operating at the same time with same objects. \textbf{Jlp22} checks some of
these conflict situations, but not all.  These conflicts can be avoided by giving
intended global arguments  in the list of arguments.
Then an object 'ob' created e.g. with transformation object \textcolor{teal}{tr} have prefix
]tr \textbackslash [ yelding ]tr \textbackslash ob[. Actually also these objects are global, but their prefix
protects them so that they do not intervene with objects having the same name in the
calling transformation objec.

Each line in the input paragraph is read and interpreted and packed into a transformation
object, and associated tr\%input and tr\%output lists are created for input and output
variables. Objects can be in both lists. Objects having names starting
with '\$' are not put into the input or output lists. The source code is saved in a text object
tr\%source. List tr\%arg contains all arguments.
	!
If a semicolon ';'  is at the end of an input line, then
the output is printed if REAL variable Prindebug has value 1 or value>2 at
the execution time. If the double semicolon ';;' is at the end then the output is
printed if Printresult>1. If there is no output, but just list of objects, then these
objects will be printed with semicolns.

\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{call}() executes TRANS object}\index{call()}

functions or they can be executed explicitly using \textcolor{VioletRed}{call}() function.

\vspace{0.2cm}

\begin{note}
A transformation objects can be used recursively, i.e. a transformation can be called from
itself. The depth of recursion is not controlled by \textbf{J}, so going too deep in recursion will
eventually lead to a system error.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
Professional programmers would probably say that the integer vector produced with the parser
is interpreted and not executed. An amateur programmer can be more flexible with terms.
\end{note}
\begin{example}[recursion]Recursion produces system crash.\\

\end{example}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() in a TRANS or in command input}\index{pause()}
\label{pause}
Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() stops the execution of \textbf{Jlp22} commands which are either in an
include file or in TRANS object. The user can give any commands during the
\textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}() except input programming commands.
If the user presses <return> the excution continues. If the user gives 'e', then
an error condition is generated, and \textbf{Jlp22} comes to the \textcolor{Red}{sit>} promt, except
if \textcolor{teal}{Continue} has values 1, in which case the control returns one level above
the \textcolor{Red}{sit>} promt.
If \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}()  has a CHAR argument, then that character constant is used as
the prompt.
\begin{note}
When reading commands from an include file, the a pause can be generated also
with \textcolor{Red}{;pause}, which works similarly as \textcolor{VioletRed}{pause}(), but during \textcolor{Red}{;pause} also input programming
commands can be given.
\end{note}
\section{Special implicit functions}
\label{special}
The special functions are such that the parser uses these functions for special operations.
Only \textcolor{VioletRed}{list2}() is function which also the user can use, but the parser is
is using it implicitly.
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{setoption}(): set option on}\index{setoption()}
\label{setoption}
When a function has an option then the parser generates first code
\textcolor{VioletRed}{setoption}(...) where the arguments of the option are interpred in the similar way as
arguments of all functions. Then the parser genarates the code for
\textcolor{VioletRed}{setoption}() function in a special way.
\subsection{Get or set a matrix element or submatrices}
\label{getelem}
Matrix elements or submatrices can be accessed using the same syntax as
accesing \textbf{Jlp22} functions.

One can get or set matrix elements and submatrices as follows. If the expression
is on the right side of '=' then \textbf{Jlp22} gets a REAL value or submatrix, if the expression
is on the left side of '=', the \textbf{Jlp22} sets new values for a matrix element or a submatrix.
In the following formulas \textcolor{teal}{C} is a column vector, \textcolor{teal}{R} a row vector, and \textcolor{teal}{M} is
a general matrix with m rows and n columns.
If \textcolor{teal}{C} is actually REAL it can
be used as if it would 1 x 1 MATRIX. This can be useful when working with
matrices whose dimensions can vary starting from 1 x 1. Symbol \textcolor{teal}{r} refers to
row index, \textcolor{teal}{r1} to first row in a row range, \textcolor{teal}{r2} to the last row. The rows and
columns can be specifiel using ILIST objects \textcolor{teal}{il1} and \textcolor{teal}{il2} to specify noncontiguous ranges.
It is currently not possible to mix ILIST range and contiguous range, so if ILIST
is needed for rows (columns), it must be used also for columns (rows). ILIST can be
specified using explicitly \textcolor{VioletRed}{ilist}() function or using {} construction.
Similarly columns are indicated  with \textcolor{teal}{c}. It is always legal to refer to
vectors by using the \textcolor{teal}{M} formulation and giving \textcolor{teal}{c} with value 1 for column vectors and
and \textcolor{teal}{r} with value 1 for row vectors.

\noindent Args \tabto{3cm} 0-4 \tabto{5cm}  REAL | ILIST \tabto{7cm}

\end {changemargin}
\hrule
\vspace{0.2cm}

Row and column ranges can be spcidie as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item  \textcolor{teal}{M}(r,c) \tabto{5cm} Get or set single element.
\item  \textcolor{teal}{C}(r)  \tabto{5cm} Get or set single element in column vector.
\item  \textcolor{teal}{R}(c) \tabto{5cm} Get or set single element in column vector.
\item  \textcolor{teal}{M}(RANGES) \tabto{5cm} Get or set a submatrix, where RANGES
can be. For a column vector, the column range need not to specified.
\begin{itemize}
\item  r1,-r2,c1,-c2
\item  r,c1,-c2  \tabto{5cm} part of row r
\item  r1,-r2,c	\tabto{5cm} part of column c
\item  r1,-r2,All  \tabto{5cm} All columns of the row range
\item  All,c1,-c2  \tabto{5cm} All rows of the column range
\item  {r1,....rm},{c1,...,cn}  \tabto{5cm} Given rows and columns
\item  {r1,....rm}  \tabto{5cm} Given rows for column vector
\item  il1,il2   \tabto{5cm} for matrix with several columns
\item  il1   \tabto{5cm} for column vector
\end{itemize}
\item  When r2= m, then -r2 can be replaced with \textcolor{teal}{Tolast}.
\item  When c2= n, then -c2 can be replaced with \textcolor{teal}{Tolast}.
\end{itemize}

If option \textcolor{blue}{diag->} is present then
\begin{itemize}
\item  \textcolor{teal}{M}(\textcolor{blue}{diag->}) Get or set the diagonal. If \textcolor{teal}{M} is not square matrix, and error
occurs.
\item  \textcolor{teal}{M}(r1,-r2,\textcolor{blue}{diag->}) (Again -r2 can be \textcolor{teal}{Tolast}.
\end{itemize}
\begin{note}
Note
When setting values to a submatrix the the the values given in input matrix
are put into the outputmatrix in row order, and the shape of the input and output matrices need
not be the same. An error occurs only if input and output contain different number of
elements.
\end{note}
\begin{example}[getset]Get or set submatrices\\
\label{getset}
A=\textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}(3,4,\textcolor{blue}{do->});\\
B=A(1,-2,3,-4);\\
A(1,-2,3,-4)=B+3;\\
A(1,-2,3,-4,\textcolor{blue}{sum->})=-5;\\
A(1,-2,3,-4,\textcolor{blue}{sum->}2)=A(2,-3,1,-2);\\
C=A({1,3},{4...2});\\

H(3,-4,\textcolor{blue}{diag->})=\textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}(2,\textcolor{blue}{values->}(4,7));
\end{example}
\begin{note}
When giving range, the lower and upper limit can be equal.
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{getelem}(): extracting information from an object}\index{getelem()}
\label{getelem0}
The origin of this function is the function which was used in previous versions
to take an matrix element, which explains the name. Now it is used to extract
also submatrices (e.g. a(1,-3,All)) , or to get value of an regression
function or to compute
a transformation and then take argument object as the result. E.g. if \textcolor{teal}{tr} is a transformation
then the result of  \textcolor{teal}{tr}(\textcolor{teal}{a}) is object \textcolor{teal}{a} after calling \textcolor{teal}{tr}.
\begin{note}
If someone starts to use the own function property of the open source \textbf{J}, she/he
probably would like to get the possiblity to extract information from her/his object types
also. To implement this property requires some co-operation from my side.
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{setelem}(): Putting something  into an object.}\index{setelem()}
\label{setelem}
The origin of this function is the function which was used in previous versions
to set an matrix element, which explains the name. Now it is used to replace values
of submatrices when submatrix expression is on the
output side (e.g. a(1,-3,All)=..).
\begin{note}
If someone starts to use the own function property of the open source \textbf{J}, she/he
probably would like to get the possiblity to put information into from her/his object types
also. To implement this property requires some co-operation from my side.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
In effect the \textcolor{VioletRed}{getelem}() and \textcolor{VioletRed}{setelem}() functions are excuted in the same
\textcolor{VioletRed}{getelem}() subroutine, because bot functions can utilize the same code.

\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{o1\_funcs}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{o2\_funcs}() and \textcolor{VioletRed}{o3\_funcs}() calls own functions}\index{o1\_funcs()o2\_funcs()o3\_funcs()}
\label{own}
The users of open \textbf{Jlp22} can define their own functions using three
available own-function sets. In addition to own functions open \textbf{Jlp22} is ready to
recognize also own object types and options which are defined in the source files
controlled by the users. The main \textbf{Jlp22} does not know what to do with these own
object types and options, they are just transmitted to the own-functions.
In the main \textbf{Jlp22} the control is transmitted to the own functions using implicit
\textbf{Jlp22} functions \textcolor{VioletRed}{o1\_funcs}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{o2\_funcs}() and \textcolor{VioletRed}{o3\_funcs}().
\section{Transformation objects}
\label{Transformations}
The code lines generated by the input programming can be either
executed directly after interpretation, or the interpreted code lines
are packed into a transformation object, which can be excuted with \textcolor{VioletRed}{call}()
which is either in the code generated with the input programming
or inside the same or other transformation object. Recursive
calling a transformation is thus also possible. Different functions
related to transformation object are described in this section.
\section{Loops and control strucures}
\label{loops}
This section describes nonstadard functions.
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{do}() loops}\index{do()}
\label{do}

The loop construction in \textbf{Jlp22} looks as follows:
\textcolor{VioletRed}{do}(i,start,end[,step])
enddo
\begin{note}
cycle and exit are implemented in the current \textbf{Jlp22} version with \textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}()
Within a do–loop there can be cycleand exitdostatements
\end{note}
\begin{note}
There can be 8 nested loops. do-loop is not allowed at command level.
\end{note}
\begin{example}[doex]do-loop\\

\subsection{ \textcolor{teal}{output}=\textcolor{teal}{input}}
\label{ASSIGN}
There are two assignment functions generated by '=', when the line is of
form \textcolor{teal}{output}=func[]input[), then the output is directly
put to the output position of the function
without explicitly generating assignment.
When the codeline is in form \textcolor{teal}{output}=\textcolor{teal}{input} then the following cases can occur

\begin{itemize}
\item  \textcolor{teal}{output} is MATRIX
and \textcolor{teal}{input} is scalar, then each element of MATRIX is replaced with the \textcolor{teal}{input}
in \textcolor{VioletRed}{assone}() function.
\item  \textcolor{teal}{output} is submatrix expression, then the elements of the
submatrix are asigned in \textcolor{VioletRed}{setelem}() funtion whether \textcolor{teal}{input} is MATRIX or submatrix
expression, scalar or LIST.

\item  \textcolor{teal}{output} is MATRIX  and on input side is a random number
generation function, the random numbers are put to all elements of the matrix.

\item If on output side are many object names, and input side is
one REAL value, this is put to all variables.

\item If on output side are many object names, and input there are several
variables then both sides should have equal numbers of object names, then
then copies of the input objects are put into output objects.

Usage://

output=\textcolor{VioletRed}{which}(condition1,value1,...,conditionn,valuen) //
or//
output=\textcolor{VioletRed}{which}(condition1,value1,...,conditionn,valuen,valuedefault)
Where conditionx is a REAL value, nonzero	value indicating TRUE. Output will get first value for which
the condition is TRUE. When the number of arguments is not even, the the last value
is the default value.

\label{errexit}
Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{errexit}() returns the control to \textcolor{Red}{sit>} prompt with a message similarly
as when an error occurs.

\end{example}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}() goto a different place in TRANS}\index{goto()}
\label{goto}
Control can be transfered to a line in a transformation set with \textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}().
There are two types of goto's, unconditional goto to a given address and goto
to an address from a group af adresses based on a condition (Computed goto in Fortran).
These are decribed in separate subsections. Notes common to both are presented here.
\begin{note}
It is not recommended to use \textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}() according to modern computation practices.
However, it was easier to implement cycle and exitdo with \textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}().
\end{note}
\begin{note}
It is not allowed to jump in to a loop or into if -then structure. This is
checked already in in the parser.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
Even if the labels are
logically character arguments, they are not treated using CHARs. The parser
handles them otherwise.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
The label lines can contain code but the labels can stand on the line also alone.
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}(label) Unconditional goto}
\label{goto1}
An unconditional \textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}() has only one address argument.
\begin{example}[gotoex]Example of unconditional goto\\
\label{gotoex}
transa=\textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}()\\
i=0\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{if}(i.eq.0)\textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}(koe)\\
out=99;\\
koe:out=88;\\
/\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{call}(transa)\\
out;
\end{example}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}(index,lable1...labeln) Conditional goto}
\label{goto2}
An conditional \textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}() selects the label from a group of labels.
\begin{example}[congotoex]\\
\label{congotoex}
transa=\textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}()\\
out=999\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}(ad1)\\
77;\\
ad1:\\
1;\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}(2,ad1,ad3)\\
88;\\
ad2:\\
2;\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}(go,ad1,ad3)\\
out=0;\\
return\\
ad3:\\
3;\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}(3,ad3,ad1,ad2)\\
/\\
go=0  ! This determines the last goto\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{call}(transa)\\
out;\\
go=4\\
** Now error occurs\\
Continue=1\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{call}(transa)\\
Continue=0\\
\textcolor{Red}{;return}
\end{example}
\begin{note}
A simulator for generating treatment schedules for forest stands
can be nicely defined using the conditional goto, as will shortly be described.

\section{Arithmetic and logical operations}
\label{arit}
The logical operations follow the same ruels as addition +. The following rules,
extending the standard matrix computaion rules apply. The same rules aplly if the
order of arguments is changed,
\begin{itemize}
\item MATRIX + REAL : REAL is added to each element

\item MATRIX1+MATRIX2 :: elementwise addition, if matrices hav comptaible dimensions
\item  MATRIX+ column vector: column vector is added to each column of MATRIX
if the numbers of rows agrees.
\item  MATRIX+ row vector: row vector is added to each
row of MATRIX
if the numbers of columns agree.

\end{itemize}
The same rules apply for the lelmentwise multiplication *. and elementwise
division /. as for addition +.
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{min}() and \textcolor{VioletRed}{max}()}\index{min()max()}
\label{minmax}
Functions \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}() and max ()
behave in a special way, \textcolor{VioletRed}{max}() behaves similarly as \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}() here:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}(x1,x2):: minimum of two REAL
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}(MATRIX,REAL):: each element is \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}(elem,REAL)
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}(MATRIX):: row vector having minimums of all columns
\item \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}(MATRIX,\textcolor{blue}{any->}):: minimum over the whole amtrix
\end{itemize}
\section{Statistical functions for matrices}
\label{matrixstat}
Functions \textcolor{VioletRed}{mean}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{sd}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{var}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{sum}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{min}() and \textcolor{VioletRed}{max}()
can be used used to compute stastics from a matrix. Let \textcolor{VioletRed}{mean}() here present
any of thes functions. The following rules apply:
\begin{itemize}
\textcolor{VioletRed}{mean}(VECTOR) computes the mean of the vector, output is REAL
\textcolor{VioletRed}{mean}(MATRIX) computes the mean of the each column. Result is row vector.
\textcolor{VioletRed}{mean}(VECTOR,\textcolor{blue}{weight->}wvector) computes the
weigted mean of the vector,weights being in vector wvector.
\textcolor{VioletRed}{mean}(MATRIX,\textcolor{blue}{weight->}wvector) computes the
weighted mean of each column, weights being in vector wvector, result is row vector.

\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{der}() Derivatives}\index{der()}
\label{der}
Derivates of a function with respect to any of its arguments can be
computed using the derivation rules by using \textcolor{VioletRed}{der}() function in the previous line. The funcion must be expressed with
one-line statement. The function can call other functions using the standard way
to obtain objects from transformations, but these functions cannot
contain variables for which derivatives are obtained.
Nonlinear regression needs the derivatives with respect to the parameters.

\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{gamma}() Gamma function}\index{gamma()}
\label{gamma}
Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{gamma}() produses the value of gamma funtion for a positive argument.
The function utilises gamma subroutine from
library dcdflib in Netlib. For computing gamma function for a product, \textcolor{VioletRed}{loggamma}() is often needed.
\ubsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{loggamma}() Log of gamma function}\index{loggamma()}
\label{loggamma}
Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{gamma}() produces the value of loggamma funtion for a positive argument.
	!
The function utilises gamma subroutine from
library dcdflib in Netlib. Loggamma is used in statistics in many cases where
gamma function gets a too large value to be presented in double precision.
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{logistic}() Logistic function}\index{logistic()}
\label{logistic}
Returns the value of the logistic function 1/(1+\textcolor{VioletRed}{exp}(-x)). This can in principle computed by the
transformation, but the transformation will produce an error condition when the argument -x
of the exp-function is large. Because the logistic function is symmetric, these cases are
computed as \textcolor{VioletRed}{exp}(x)/(1+\textcolor{VioletRed}{exp}(x)). Because the logistic function can be needed in the nonlinear
regression, also the derivatives are implemented.  Note, to utilize derivatives
the function needs to be in a TRANS object.
Eg when f=\textcolor{VioletRed}{logistic}(a*(x-x0)), then
the derivatives can be obtained with respect to the parameters a and x0 by
\begin{example}[logisticex]Example of logistic function\\
\label{logisticex}
transa=\textcolor{VioletRed}{trans}()\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{der}(a,x0)\\
f=\textcolor{VioletRed}{logistic}(a*(x-x0));\\
/

\textcolor{VioletRed}{call}(transa)
\end{example}
\begin{note}
In the previous example tr(d[x0] ahs the effect that TRANS tr is first
called, which makes that also d[a] and d[x] have been computed. Remember that
the parse tree is computed from right to left.

\end {changemargin}
\hrule
\vspace{0.2cm}

\begin{note}
there are different ways to define the negative binomial distribution. In this definition
a Poisson random variable with mean \$\lamda\$ is obtained by letting r go
to infinity and defining p= \$\lamda\$/( \$\lamda\$+r)
The mean E(x) of this definition is p*r/(1-p) and the variance is V=p*r/(1-p)2. Thus given
E(x) and V, r and p can be obtained as follows: p=1- E(x) /V and r= E(x)**2/(V- E(x)) . This is useful when
simulating ‘overdispersed Poisson’ variables. Sorry for the (temporary) inconsistency of parameters with
function \textcolor{VioletRed}{negbin}().
\end{note}
\begin{note}
can also have a noninteger values. This is not in accordance with the above
interpretation of the distribution, but it is compatible with interpreting negative binomial
distribution as a compound gamma-Poisson distribution and it is useful when simulating
overdispersed Poisson distributions.

\section{Interpolation}
\label{inter}
The following functions can be used for interpolation
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{interpolate}() Linear interpolation}\index{interpolate()}
\label{interpolate}
Usage://
\textcolor{VioletRed}{interpolate}(x0,x1[,x2],y0,y1[,y2],x]//
If arguments x2 and y2 are given then computes the value of the quadratic function at value
x going through the three points, otherwise computes the value of the linear function at value
x going through the two points.
\begin{note}
The argument x need not be within the interval of given x values (thus the function also
extrapolates).
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{plane}() Interpolates an a plane}\index{plane()}
\label{plane}
Usage://
\textcolor{VioletRed}{plane}(x1,x2,x3,y1,y2,y3,z1,z2,z3,x,y]//
The function computes the equation of plane going through the three points (x1,y1,z1), etc
and computes the value of the z-coordinate in point (x,y). The three points defining the plane
cannot be on single line.
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{bilin}() Bilinear interpolation}\index{bilin()}
\label{bilin}
Usage://
\textcolor{VioletRed}{bilin}(x1,x2,y1,y2,z1,z2,z3,z4,x,y]//
z1 is the value of function at point (x1,y1), z2 is the value at point (x1,y2), z3 is the value at
(x2,y1) and z4 is the value at (x2,y2): the function is using bilinear interpolation to compute
the value of the z-coordinate in point (x,y). The point (x,y) needs not be within the square
defined by the corner points, but it is good if it is. See Press et al. ? (or Google) for the principle
of bilinear interpolation
\section{List functions}
\label{lists}
The following list functions are available
\subsection{Object lists}
\label{listo}

\section{TEXT and TXT text objects}
\label{texts}
The are now two object types for text.
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{text}() Creates TEXT}\index{text()}
\label{text}
Text objects are created as a side product by many \textbf{Jlp22} functions. Text objects can be created
directly by the \textcolor{VioletRed}{text}() function which works in a nonstandard way. The syntax is:
output=\textcolor{VioletRed}{text}()//
…
//

The input paragraph ends exceptionally with '//' and not with '/'. The lines within the input
paragraph of text are put literally into the text object (i.e. even if there would be input
programming functions or structures included)
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{txt}() Creates TXT}\index{txt()}
\label{txt}
Works as \textcolor{VioletRed}{text}(), to be documented later. The new TXT object is used
to implement \textcolor{Red}{;incl} and Gnuplot -figures.
\section{File handling}
\label{file}
The following functions can handle files.
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{exist\_f}(): does a file exist}\index{exist\_f()}
\label{existf}
looks whether a file with the name given in
the character constant  argument exists.
\begin{note}
In the previous versions of \textbf{Jlp22} same function was used for files and objects.
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{delete\_o}() Deletes files}\index{delete\_o()}
\label{delete_f}
The function \textcolor{VioletRed}{delete\_f}() deletes all files having the names given in the arguments.
The arguments can be character constants or character variables associated with character
constants. After deleting a file whose name is given in character variable, the variable still refers to the same
chracter constant.
\begin{example}[deletfex]Deletef file\\
\label{deletfex}
\textcolor{VioletRed}{write}('delete\_fex.txt',\$,'a=\textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}(2,4,\textcolor{blue}{do->});')\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{write}('delete\_fex.txt',\$,'\textcolor{VioletRed}{delete\_o}(a)')\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{write}('delete\_fex.txt',\$,'a;')\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{close}('delete\_fex.txt')\\
\textcolor{Red}{;incl}(delete\_fex.txt)\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{delete\_f}('delete\_fex.txt')
\end{example}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{close}() Closes a file}\index{close()}
\label{close}
\textcolor{VioletRed}{close}(file) closes an open file where file is either a character constant
or character variable associated with a file.
\begin{note}
No open(9)function is needed. An file is opened when it is first time in \textcolor{VioletRed}{write}() or
\textcolor{VioletRed}{print}(\textcolor{blue}{file->}).
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{showdir}() shows the current directory}\index{showdir()}
\label{showdir}
\begin{note}
showdir is defined in the system dependent file jsysdep\_gfortran.f90.
Using other compliers it may be neccessary to change the definition
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{setdir}() sets the current directory}\index{setdir()}
\label{setdir}
\begin{note}
setdir is defined in the system dependent file jsysdep\_gfortran.f90.

\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{thisfile}() Name of the current \textcolor{Red}{;incl} -file}\index{thisfile();incl}
\label{thisfile}
The name of the current include file is returned as a character variable by:
out=\textcolor{VioletRed}{thisfile}()
This is useful when defining shortcuts for commands that include sections from an include file.
Using this function the shortcuts work even if the name of the include file is changed. See file
jexamples.inc for an application
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{filestat}() Information of a file}\index{filestat()}
\label{filestat}
Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{filestat}(filename) prints the size of the
file in bytes (if available) and the time the file was last accessed
\section{Io-functions}
\label{io}
Theree are following io functions
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{read}() Reads from file}\index{read()}
\label{read}
\textcolor{VioletRed}{read}(file,format[,obj1,…,objn][,\textcolor{blue}{eof->}var] [,\textcolor{blue}{wait->}])//
Reads real variables or matrices from a file. If there are no objects
to be read, then a record is
by-passed.//
Arguments:
file the file name as a character variable or a character constant//
format//
b' unformatted (binary) data //
'bn' unformatted, but for each record there is integer for the size of the record. Does
not work when reading matrices.
'bis' binary data consisting of bytes, each value is converted to real value (the only
numeric data type in J). This works only when reading matrices.//
'(….)' a Fortran format. Does not work when reading matrices.
\$ the * format of Fortran//
obj1,…,objn
\textbf{Jlp22} objects//
Options://
eof Defines the variable which indicates the end of file condition of the file. If the end
of the file is not reached the variable gets the value 0, and when the end of file is
reached then the variable gets value 1 and the file is closed without extra notice.

When \textcolor{blue}{eof->} option is not present and the file ends then an error
condition occurs and the file is closed.//
wait \textbf{Jlp22} is waiting until the file can be opened. Useful in client-server applications. See
chapter \textbf{Jlp22} as a server.
\begin{note}
Use \textcolor{VioletRed}{ask}() or \textcolor{VioletRed}{askc}() to read values from the terminal when reading lines from an
include file.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
When reading matrices, their shapes need to
be defined earlier with \textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}()
hfunction.
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{write}() Writes to console or to file}\index{write()}
\label{write}
\textcolor{VioletRed}{write}(file,format,val1,…,valn[,\textcolor{blue}{tab->}][,\textcolor{blue}{rows->}])! case[1/6]
Writes real values to a file or to the console. If val1 is a matrix then this matrix (or usually
vector) is written or at most as many values as given in the \textcolor{blue}{values->} option.
Arguments:
file variable \$ (indicating the console), or the name of the file as a character variable
or a character constant, or variable \$Buffer
format
\$ indicates the '*' format of Fortran, works only for numeric values.
A character expression, with the following possibilities:
A format starting with 'b' will indicate binary file. Now 'b' indicates ordinary
unformatted write, later there will be other binary formats
A Fortran format statement, e.g. ($\sim$the values were $\sim$,4f6.0), with this
format pure text can be written by having no object to write (e.g.
\textcolor{VioletRed}{write}('out.txt','($\sim$kukuu$\sim$)')).
For these formats, other arguments are supposed to be real variables or numeric
expressions or there is a matrix argument. If they are not, then just the real value
which is anyhow associated with each \textbf{Jlp22} object is printed (usually it will be zero).
If the val1 argument is a matrix, then all values are printed.
val1,…,valn
real values
Options:
tab if format is a Fortran format then, \textcolor{blue}{tab->} option indicates that sequences of
spaces are replaced by tab character so that written text can be easily converted
to Ms Word tables. If there are no decimals after the decimal point also the
decimal point is dropped.
rows If val1 is a matrix or a vector and \textcolor{blue}{rows->} has one argument then at most as
many values are written as given in this option, if there are two arguments then
the option gives the range of written rows in the form \textcolor{blue}{rows->}(row1,-row2). If the
upper limit is greater than the number of rows, no error is produced, all available
rows are just written.
\textcolor{VioletRed}{write}(file,'t',t1,val1,t2,val2,…,tn,valn[,\textcolor{blue}{tab->}]) ! case[2/6]
Tabulation format. positive tab position values indicate that the value is written starting from
that position, negative tab positions indicate that the value is written up to that position. The
values can be either numeric expressions or character variables or character constants. Tab
positions can be in any order.
Arguments:
file variable \$ (indicating the console), or the name of the file as a character variable
or a character constant, or variable \$Buffer
't' tabulation format
t1,val1,t2,val2,…,tn,valn
KUVAUS
Options:
tab option indicates that sequences of spaces are replaced by tab character so that
writ-ten text can be easily converted to Ms Word tables.

\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{print}() Prints objects to file or console}\index{print()}
\label{print}
\textcolor{VioletRed}{print}(arg1,…,argn[,\textcolor{blue}{maxlines->}][,\textcolor{blue}{data->}][,\textcolor{blue}{row->}]

Print values of variables or information about objects.//
Arguments:
arg1,…,argn
arguments can be any \textbf{Jlp22} objects or values of arithmetic or logical expressions or
the only argument can be name of a text file.
Options:
maxlines&-1|1&REAL& the maximum number of lines printed for matrices, default 100.
any& -1|0 && if the argument is the name of a text file, then \textcolor{blue}{any->} indicates that
the file is read to the end and the number  of lines is put into variable Accepted.
data&-1|1 &DATA & data sets. If \textcolor{blue}{data->} option is given then arguments must be ordinary real
variables obtained from data.
row if a text object is printed, then the first value given in the \textcolor{blue}{row->} option gives the
first line to be printed. If a range of lines is printed, then the second argument
must be the negative of the last line to be printed (e.q. \textcolor{blue}{row->}(10,-15)).Note
that \textcolor{VioletRed}{nrows}() function can be used to get the number of rows.
file the file name as a character variable or a character constant. Redirects the output

\section{Matrix functions}
\label{matrixs}
\textbf{Jlp22} contains now the following matrix functions.
\subsection{Matrices and vectors}
\label{matrixo}
Matrices and vectors are generated with the \textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}() function or they are
produced by matrix operations, matrix functions or by other \textbf{Jlp22} functions. E.g.
the \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}() function is producing a data matrix as a part of the compound data
object. Matrix elements can be used in arithmetic operations as input or output
in similar way as real variables.
See Matrix computations.
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}() Creates MATRIX}\index{matrix()}
\label{matrix}
Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}() creates a matrix and puts REAL values to the elements. Element values
can be read from the input paragraph, file, or the values can be generated
using \textcolor{blue}{values->} option, or sequential values can be generated
using \textcolor{blue}{do->} option. Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}() can generate a diagonal and block diagonal matrix.
A matrix can be generated from submatrices by using matrices as arguments
of the  \textcolor{blue}{values->} option. It should be noted that matrices are stored in row order.

\noindent  If a 1x1 matrix is defined, the output will be REAL.
The output can be a temporary matrix without name, if \textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}() is an argument
of an arithmetic function  or matrix function. If no element values are
given in \textcolor{blue}{values->} or obtained from \textcolor{blue}{in->} input, all elemets get value zero.

the second argument, if present, the number of columns.  If the matrix is generated from submatrices given in \textcolor{blue}{values->}, then the dimensions
refer to the submatrix rows and submatrix columns. If there are no arguments, then the
it should be possible to infer the dimensions from \textcolor{blue}{values->} option. If the
first argument is \textcolor{teal}{Inf}, the the number of rows is determined by the number
number of lines in source determined by \textcolor{blue}{in->}.

in both cases a record must contain one row for the matrix.
If there is reading error and values are read from the terminal, \textbf{Jlp22} gives
possibility to continue with better luck, otherwise an error occurs.

\textcolor{blue}{values->} option go in the regular way
through the interpreter, so the values can be obtained by computations. If only one REAL value is
given then all diagonal elements are put equal to the value (ohers will be zero),
if \textcolor{blue}{diag->} option is present, otherwise all elements are put equal to this value. If matrix dimensions
are given, and there are fewer values than is the size the matrix, matrix is
filled row by row using all values given in
\textcolor{blue}{values->}. If there are more values as is the size, an error occurs unless there is
\textcolor{blue}{any->} option present.
Thus \textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}(N,N,\textcolor{blue}{values->}1) generates the identity matrix.
If value-> refers to one MATRIX,and \textcolor{blue}{diag->} is present then a block diagonal
matrix is generated. Without \textcolor{blue}{diag->}, a partitioned matrix is generated having all
submatrices equal

\begin{note}
Multiplying a matrix by the transpose of a matrix can be made by
making new operation '*.

\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{inverse}() Inverse and condition number of MATRIX}\index{inverse()}
\label{inverse}
\textcolor{VioletRed}{inverse}(matrixa) computes the inverse of a square MATRIX matrixa. The function utilized dgesv funtion
of netlib. If the argument has type REAL, then the reciprocal is computed,
and the output will also have type REAL. An error occurs, if matrixa is not
a square matrix or REAL, or matrixa is singular according to dgesv.
The condition number is stored in REAL with name Output\%condition.

\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{qr}() QR decomposition of MATRIX}\index{qr()}
\label{qr}
Makes QR decomposition of a MATRIX This can be used to study if columns of a are linearly
dependent. \textbf{Jlp22} prints a matrix which indicates the structure of the upper diagonal matrix R in the
qr decomposition. If column k is linearly dependent on previous columns the k’th diagonal
element is zero. If output is given, then it will be the r matrix. Due to rounding errors diagonal
elements which are interpreted to be zero are not exactly zero. Explicit r matrix is useful if user
thinks that \textbf{Jlp22} has not properly interpreted which diagonal elements are zero.
In \textbf{Jlp22}  \textcolor{VioletRed}{qr}() may be useful when it is studied why a matrix which shoudl
be nonsingular turns out to be singular in \textcolor{VioletRed}{inverse}() or \textcolor{VioletRed}{solve}().
\textcolor{VioletRed}{qr}() is using  the subroutine dgeqrf from Netlib.
An error occurs if the argument is not MATRIX or if dgeqrf produces
error code, which is just printed.
Now the function just shows the linear dependencies, as sho in the examples.

\section{Working with DATAs}
\label{datahead}
Data can be analyzed and processed either using matrix computations
or using DATAs. A DATA is compound object
linked to a data MATRIX and LIST containing variable (column) names,
some other information.
When data ere used via DATA in statistical or linear programming
functions, the data are processed observarion by observation.
It is possible to work using DATA or using directly the data matrix, wharever is more
convenient. It is posible make new data objects or new matrices
by to extracting  columns of data matrix, computing matrices with matrix computations.
It is possible to use data in hierarcchila way, This property is inherited fro JLP.
There are two \textbf{Jlp22} functions which create DATAs from files, \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}() and
exceldta(). \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}() can create hierarchical data objects. Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{newdata}() creates a DATA from matrices, which temselfs can be
picked from data objects. Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{linkdata}() can link two data sets to make a hierarchical data.
\begin{note}
If a data file contains columns which are referred with variable names and some vectors,
the it is practical to read data first into a matrix using \textcolor{VioletRed}{matrix}() function and then
use matrix operations and \textcolor{VioletRed}{newdata}() to make DATA with variable names and matrices.
See Simulator section for an example.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
\textcolor{VioletRed}{transdata}() function goes through a DATA similarly as statitical functions, but
does not serve a specific purpose, just transformations defined in the TRANS object refreed with
\textcolor{blue}{trans->} option are computed. See again the simulator section.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
In earlier versions it was possible to give several data sets as arguments for \textcolor{blue}{data->} option.
This festure is now deleted as it is possible to stack several data matrices and then use \textcolor{VioletRed}{newdata}() function to create a single data set.
\end{note}
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{data}() Making a DATA}\index{data()}
\label{data}
Data objects are created with the \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}() function. Two linked data objects can be created with the
same function call (using option \textcolor{blue}{subdata->} and options thereafter in the following
description). It is recommended that two linked data objects are created with one \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}()
function call only in case the data is read from a single file where subdata observations are
stored immediately after the upper data observation.  Data objects can be linked also afterwards with the \textcolor{VioletRed}{linkdata}() function.
A data object can created by a \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}() function when data are read from files
or data are created using transformation objects. New data objects can
be created with \textcolor{VioletRed}{newdata}() function from previous data objects and/or matrices.
If data objects can created using transformation objects either with \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}() function
or by creating first data matrix by transformation and then using \textcolor{VioletRed}{newdata}() to
create data object.

of data object this way is indicated by the presence of \textcolor{blue}{nobs->} option and absence
of \textcolor{blue}{in->} and \textcolor{blue}{read->} options. Second, if \textcolor{blue}{read->} option is present \textcolor{blue}{nobs->}
option can be used to indicate how many records are read from a file and what
will be the number of observations. Currently \textcolor{blue}{reject->} or \textcolor{blue}{filter->} can not
be used to reject records (consult authors if this would be needed). If there are
fewer records in file as given in \textcolor{blue}{nobs->} option, an error occurs. There are three
reasons for using \textcolor{blue}{nobs->} option this way. First, one can read a small sample
from a large file for testing purposes. Second, the reading is slightly faster as the
data can be read directly into proper memory area without using linked buffers.
Third, if the data file is so large that a virtual memory overflow occurs, then it may
be possible to read data in as linked buffers are not needed.
In case \textcolor{blue}{nobs->} option is present and \textcolor{blue}{read->} option is absent either
\textcolor{blue}{maketrans->} or \textcolor{blue}{keep->} option (or both) is required.

Generates data object from csv data generated with excel. It is assumed that ';' is used as column separator,
and first is the header line generated with excel and containing column names.
The second line contains information for \textbf{Jlp22} how to read the data.
First the first line is copied and pasted as the second line. To the beginning of the second line is put
'@\#'. Then each entry separated by ';' is edited as follows. If the column is just ignored, then
put '!' to the beginning of the entry. If all characters in the column are read in as
a numeric variable, change the name to accpetable variable name in \textbf{J}.
If the column is read in but it is just used as an input variable fot
\textcolor{blue}{maketrans->} trasformations, then start the name with '\$' so the variable is not put to
the list of \textcolor{blue}{keep->} variables. If a contains only character values then it must
be ignored using '!'. If the contains numeric values surrounded by characters, the the numeric value can be picked
as follows. Put '?' to the end of entry. Put the variable name to the beginning of the entry.
then put the the number of characters to be ignored by two digits, inserting
aleading zero if needed. The given the length of the numeric field to be read in as a numeric value.
For instance, if the header line in the excel file is
\color{Green}
\begin{verbatim}
Block;Contract;Starting time;Name of municipality;Number of stem;Species code
\end{verbatim}
\color{Black}
and the first data line could be
\color{Green}
\begin{verbatim}
MG\_H100097362501;20111001;7.5.2021 9:37;Akaa;20;103;1;FI2\_Spruce
\end{verbatim}
\color{Black}
then the second line before the first data line could be
\color{Green}
\begin{verbatim}
\#\#block0808?;!Contract;!Starting time;!Name of municipality;stem;species0201?
\end{verbatim}
\color{Black}
therafter the first observation would get values block=97362501,stem=1, and
species=2.

If there are several input files, the header line of later input lines is ignored, and
also if the second line of later files starts with '\#\#', then it is ignored.
if any later lines in any input files start with 'jcode:', then the code is computed.
This way variables decribing the whole input file can be transmitted to the data.
Currently jcode-output variables can be transmitted to data matrix only by using the as pseudo
outputvariables in maketrans-transformations, e.g., filevar1=filevar1, if
filevar1 is generated in jcode transformation.
If there are several input files the file number is put into variable In before computing maketrans transformations
and this variable is automatically stored in the data matrix.

\begin{note}
In most cases links between data sets can be either made using sub-options of \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}()
function or \textcolor{VioletRed}{linkdata}() function. If there is need to duplicate lower level observations, then
this can be currently made only in \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}() function. Also when the data for both the upper
level and lower level data are read from the same file, then \textcolor{VioletRed}{data}() function must be used.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
When using linked data in other functions, the values of the upper level variables are
automatically obtained when accessing lower level observations. Which is the observational
unit in each function is determined which data set is given in \textcolor{blue}{data->} option or defined using
Data list.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
In the current version of \textbf{Jlp22} it is no more necassary to use linked data sets in
\textcolor{VioletRed}{jlp}() function, as the treatment unit index in data containing both
stand and schedule data can be given in \textcolor{blue}{unit->} option
\end{note}
\begin{note}
When making a file which can be used in \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlp}() there must be a variable which is the indicator for the unit.
If the upper level data has obs-variable which is different than the obs-variable of the lower level
data, the this is put into the DATA. But if the obs-variablers are the same, e.g., the default Obs-variable,
then the \textcolor{blue}{unit->} variable is named as Unit.

\section{Linear programming theory}
\label{LP}
This chapter will later describe more closely the theoretical aspects of the linear programming
functions. Now only some key concepts are listed. Now the reader is referred to the old
JLP manual (Lappi 1992) and Hyv\"onen et al

The concepts in the JLP algorithm


\begin{itemize}
\item In a optimization problem with schedules generated for each stand, there must be a area
constraint for each stand telling that shares of schedules add up to one in each stand.
\item In the generalized upper bound (GUB) technique of Dantzik and van Slyke, the area contraints can
be dropped with slight overhead cost.
\item The heuristic algorithm of Hoganson and Rose (1984) and
Hoganson and Kapple (1991) lead to similar computations where a schedule
in  a stand is selected using shadow prices. Their shadow prices are updated heuritically but
JLP algorith updates the prices using the linear programming theory.
\item The key concept in GUB is the key variable, in our case the key schedule, which is
any of the schedules which has nonzero weight.
\item JLP algorithm is also using the ordinary upper bound technique. If there is both
lower and upper bound in a contraint, the standard theory assumes that the lower bound and upper bound
constraints are presented  as different constraints. In the ordinary upper bound technique there
is only one constraint, and the algorithm keeps either of the bounds as the active bound.
\item JLP of Lappi (1992) introduced domains, i.e.. subsets of stands into the problem
defition. They decrease the memory needs and help to formulate more reasonable problems.
Their utility to define spatial constraints is not fully utilized.
\item When a constraint is not binding, standard algorithms, a residual variable tells
the difference between the contraint row and the active bound. Algorithm of Lappi (1992)
reduced the dimension of the basis matrix.
\item Lappi (1992) used own matrix subroutines which computed all the time the explicit inverse
of the basis matrix. \textbf{Jlp22} is using matrix routines of Fletcher based on Flethcer (1996)
\item In Lappi and Lempinen (2014) the GUB technique is extended to deal with
constraints telling that all harvested logs are transported to somewhere. Hyv\"onen et
al (2019) applied the algorithm in a small project in North-Carelia. Note that the DTRAN algoritm can deal with
factories also.
\item In optimization with factories, there is for any log type harvested in a given time a
key factory to which something is transported.
\end{itemize}
\section{Linear programming (JLP) functions}
\label{jlpintro}
There are linear programming functions for defining and solving ordinary LP-problems or
LP problems found in forest management planning.
\subsection{Problem definition object}
\label{problemo}
Problem definition object is a compound object produced by the \textcolor{VioletRed}{problem}() function, and it is
described in Linear programming.
\subsection{\textcolor{VioletRed}{problem}() PROB for \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlp}() and \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlpz}()}\index{problem()jlp()jlpz()}
\label{problem}
An LP-problem is defined in similar way as a TEXT object.
The following rules apply for problem rows:
\begin{itemize}
\item On the left there is any number of terms separated with + or -.
\item Each term is either a variable name or coefficient*variable.
\item A coefficient can be
\begin {itemize}
\item a number
\item Computation code inside parenthesis. These coefficients are computed within \textcolor{VioletRed}{problem}().
\item computation code within apostrophes. These coefficients are computed in \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlp}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlpz}() or \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlpcoef}() functions.
\item  A legal name for an object.
\end{itemize}
\item The variable must be a legal object name.
The optimization variable can either be a z-variable or x-variable.
A x-variable is an variable in schedules data set.
In \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlpz}() all variables are z variables. Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlpz}() unpacks lists to z-variables.
\item The right side of the first row ends either by ==min or ==max.
\item On the right side for other rows there is a number or code for computing a numeric value
within parnthesis or within apostrophes or a variable name. Numbers within parenthesis are
computed within \textcolor{VioletRed}{problem}() but numbers within apostrophes are computed in \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlp}(), \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlpz}() or \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlpcoef}() functions.
Between the left side and the right side there is\\
\begin{itemize}
\item  >Low <Up
\item >Low
\item = Value
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Sign < means less or equal, and > means greater or equal. Pure less or greater would be meaningless in this context.\\
If there two different identical rows
the other having '<' and the other '>', an error occurs, because the solution is obtained faster that way.
If all rows have both lower limit and upper limit, the solution is obtained in half time
when merging the lines.

In problems with x-data, there can be domain rows, which tell for what subset
of the treament units the following constraints apply.
Domains are defined using c-variables, i.e. variables in the unit data,
or in nonhierarchical, flat data set, the value of the c-variable is obtained
from the first observation where the variable given in \textcolor{blue}{unit->} gets a different
value than in the previous observation. The variables in the flat data file
having the same value for all observations in the same unit are called also c-variables.
Later there will be variables related to factory problems.
A domain definition ends with ':'. In a domain row there can be any number of domain definitions.
There are three diffent kinds of domain definitions\\
All indicates all units. This domain is assumed to all rows before the first domain row.\\
c-variable, a nonzero value tells that the unit belongs to the domain.\\
A piece of code which tells how the  indicator is computed from the c-variables. A nonzero value indicates
that the unit belongs to the domain. Recall tha logical operations produce 1 for True and 0 for false.
The code is parsed at this point, so syntax errors are detected at this point,
but other errors (e.g. division by zero) are detected in \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlp}().

\section{Plotting figures}
\label{Plotting}
The graphiscs of the current version of \textbf{Jlp22} is produced Gnuplot. \textbf{Jlp22} offers nowan alternative interface
to Gnuplot, and it is quite easy to add more plotinng routines later.
\subsection{Figures inp \textbf{Jlp22}}
\label{figu}
Figures are made using Gnuplot. \textbf{Jlp22} transmits information into Gnuplot using text files.
\textbf{Jlp22} generates the files using .jfig extension. Necessary files are generated  by deleting old
files without asking permission. If \textcolor{teal}{fig} is the output of a figure function, then
\textbf{Jlp22} creates always, except in 3D, file with name \textcolor{teal}{fig}.jfig and possibly other files with
.jfi0, jfi1  etc extensions.
All figure functions use the following options.

\hrule
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{note}
is possible to show a figure using \textcolor{VioletRed}{show}() function. It can have either the \textcolor{teal}{fig} object as the
argument or the file name of \textcolor{teal}{fig}.jfig -file. Thus it is possible
to edit the file using Gnuplot capabilites.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
It is possible to change the terminal type used by Gnuplot by giving
the name of the terminal to the predefine CHAR variable \textcolor{teal}{Terminal}.
The default is \newline \textcolor{teal}{Terminal}='qt'.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
The default writte by Gnuplot does not look nice and is not implemented.
The user can write own legends using \textcolor{blue}{label->} option in \textcolor{VioletRed}{drawline}().
\end{note}
\begin{note}
Easiest way to delete an nonmatrix object \textcolor{teal}{fi} is \textcolor{teal}{fi}=0, which makes it possible
to use \textcolor{blue}{append->} also for an \textcolor{teal}{fi} wihtout the need to construct if then-
structures.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
Graphic functions produce FIGURE objects. Each FIGURE object can consist of
several subfigures. Each FIGURE object stores information of x- and y axes, the
range of all x- and y-values, and for each sub-figure information of the ranges
of x and y in the subfigure plus the subfigure type and the needed data values.
Currently, when Gnuplot is used for graphics, most data values are stored
in text files which Gnuplot reads. Function \textcolor{VioletRed}{plot3d}() is plotting 3-d figures
without making a FIGURE object.

\textcolor{VioletRed}{tautspline}(x1,…,xn,y1,…,yn[,\textcolor{blue}{par->}][,\textcolor{blue}{sort->}][,\textcolor{blue}{print->}])//
Output://
An interpolating cubic spline, which is more robust than an ordinary cubic spline. To prevent
oscillation (which can happen with splines) the function adds automatically additional knots
where needed.//
Arguments://
x1,…,xn the x values//
d1,…,dn the y values.//
There must be at least 3 knot point, i.e. 6 arguments.//
Options://
par Parameter determining the smoothness of the curve. The default is zero,
which produces ordinary cubic spline. A typical value may 2.5. Larger values mean
that the spline is more closely linear between knot points.//
sort the default is that the x’s are increasing, if not then \textcolor{blue}{sort->} option must be given//
print if \textcolor{blue}{print->} option is given, the knot points are printed (after possible sorting).
The resulting spline can be utilized using \textcolor{VioletRed}{value}() function.
The taut spline algorithm is published by de Boor (1978) on pages 310-314. The source code
was loaded from Netlib.

used to indicate logical values. A BITMATRIX object is produced by \textcolor{VioletRed}{bitmatrix}()
function or by \textcolor{VioletRed}{closures}() function from an existing bitmatrix. Bitmatrix values
can be read from the input stream or file or set by \textcolor{VioletRed}{setvalue}() function. The

\section{Co-operation between \textbf{Jlp22} and R}
\label{JR}
Is is possible to run R scripst from \textbf{Jlp22} and \textbf{Jlp22} scripts from R.
\subsection{ \textcolor{VioletRed}{R}() Executes an R-script}\index{R()}
\label{R}
An R script can be executed with \textcolor{VioletRed}{R}(script) where script is CHAR object
defining the script text file. The function is calling //
call execute\_command\_line('Rscript.lnk '//j\_filename(1:le), wait=.false.)//
Thus a shortcut for the Rscript program needs to be available.
\begin{example}[Rex]Example of Rscript\\
\label{Rex}
rscript=\textcolor{VioletRed}{text}()\\
\# A simple R-script that generates a small data to file mydat.txt\\
wd<-"C:/jlp22/jmanual"\\
x<-runif(10,0,10)\\
y<-cbind(1,x)\%*\%c(1,2)+rnorm(10)\\
mydat<-data.frame(y,x)\\
write.\textcolor{VioletRed}{table}(mydat,file=paste(wd,"/mydat.txt",sep=""))\\
//\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{write}('miniscript.r',rscript)\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{close}('miniscript.r')\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{R}('miniscript.r')\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{print}('mydat.txt')\\
\textcolor{VioletRed}{delete\_f}('mydat.txt','miniscript.r')
\end{example}
\subsection{Calling \textbf{Jlp22}-scripts from R}
\label{Rcalls}
File JR\_0.0.tar.gz in the folder J\_R contains R tarball for taking \textbf{Jlp22}  subroutines into R.
With R command JR(”testr.inc”) the example jp problem can be solved from R.
Later lauri Mehtat\"alo will develop this co-operation further so that R can directly access also
matrices in the \textbf{Jlp22} memory.
For further information contact lauri.mehtatalo@luke.fi
THIS DOES NOT WORK NOW We will reconsider it soon with Lauri
\section{Future development}
\label{future}
The previous version contained possiblities to include factories into the optimization.
Factory optimization is not available in the current version, because I'm now
building a completely new version. I have already cleaned the data structures
of linear programming
and put the algorithm into reasonable subroutines. This makes it possible to
follow and optimized the
the flow of control. This made it already possible to put ordinary linear programming
into a separate \textcolor{VioletRed}{jlpz}() function.

I think that the current version of \textbf{Jlp22} provides many possibilities for future developments.
For instance:
\begin{itemize}
\item\item The current version does not have any special functions
for making simulators. The new \textcolor{VioletRed}{goto}() commands, possibility to work with submatrices,
and the new \textcolor{VioletRed}{transdata}() function provide much more efficient ways to develop simulators.
Examples will be provided shortly.
\item Using the possibility to compute derivatives using the analytic derivates makes it quite straightforward
to make it possible to have a nonlinear objective function and nonlinear constraints. These things
are under design.
\item It would be quite easy to inclued tools for piecewise linear constraints
and objectives.
\item It would be quite easy to develop \textbf{Jlp22} so that integer solution is produced with respect to the
schedule weight.
\item It would be interesting to see how \textbf{Jlp22} can put to work with Heureka.
\item The possiblity to run R scripts from \textbf{Jlp22} and \textbf{Jlp22} scripts from R provide new possiblities.
\item \textbf{Jlp22} can now be used as an interface to Gnuplot.
Google search show how many possiblities Gnuplot provides.
It is quite straightforward to implement these graphs if it is not currently possible.
\item The possibility to generate random numbers from any discrete or continuous distribution provide new
possibilities to study the effects of random errors in the optimization.
\item The new tools for analyzing grouped data are useful when studying the grouped data. it would
be straightforward to implement mixed model methods based on expected means squares.

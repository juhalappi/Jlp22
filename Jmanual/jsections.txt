!Section changes Recent changes

!After renaming the software to Jlp22, this chapter starts to describe changes in new versions.
! The corrections of errors are not described in detail. The first version of Jlp22 contains so many new properties that also old users 
!should look at the manual. All the examples of the manual should now go through using ALL in running

! I (in this manual 'I' refers to the first author) found recently a bug in Fletchers code. When after some pivot steps only residual variables
! are in the basis, the code computed wrong shadow prices, and the objective was getting worse.
! This situation will not happen in ordinary linear programming problems. When hunting the bug, I developed new 
! debugging tools, so I hope that all users would now send problematic
!runs to me.

!Section preface0 Preface
!\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}
! The Jlp22 software is the newest version of J software. Don Shepard told via Fortran Discourse that 
 ! that there is already J programming language. In order to avoid confusion, 
 ! the name of J is now changed 
 ! into Jlp22, the name which shows the inheritance from JLP. The name J was used in everything which  happened
 ! to the software before this point. 
 	! In the current version Jlp22, the beef if still the linear programming in forest management planning.
!	But Jlp22 has so many tools for
! data management and numeric computations,	that also vegetarians can use it.
! Perhaps these tools will be first used for preprocessing  data and postprocessing
!the results in conjuction of linear programming. The random number generators
! provide possiblities to do risk computations related to linear programming within Jlp22.
 
! \subsection*{History of J before Luke}
!\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{History of J before Luke}
 
 ! JLP is the linear programming (LP) software I made for the forest planning system Mela
 ! which was created by Markku Siitonen in Finnish Forest Researc Institute (Metla). In Mela, a simulator generates a large number of treatment schedules
 ! for each stand in a group of stands. In an optimization problem a linear combination of sums of
  ! variables (e.g. amount of harvested sawlogs dutring a period) produced in treatments is maximized or minimized subject to constraints which are also
	! linear combinations of variables. JLP was published 1992 and 
	! Finnish Forest Research Institute (Metla) started to distribute it.
! I wrote most part of it when payed by Academy of Finland. I reinvented  the generalized
! upper bound technique of Dantzik and Van Slyke. The key idea is to remove with algebraic tricks 
! the area constraints which
! tell that areas of different schedules add to the total area of the stand. In a typical problem the data can consist of 10000 stands, and and 
! optimization problem can consist of 10 contraints for the sums ofe variables. Using an ordinary LP software 
! in one iterative optimization step, a matrix consisting of 100200100 elements is updated. 
!In JLP the equivalent 
! step is computed by updating a matrix consisting 100 elements.
 ! NMBU started to use JLP from the beginning in its GAYA software which was then called GAYA-JLP.
 ! JLP allowed to compute new variables from the simulated variables. It allowed also to add 
! nicely constraints for domains, i.e. subsets of stands. JLP was programmed
 ! in Fortran77, which did not have
! dynamic allocation, pointers or own data types.

! I wrote J as a successor for JLP. First version of J,
  ! version 0.9.3 was published in August 2004. The beef in J was the same linear programming 
	! algorithm as in JLP. J was written in Fortran90 and now 
	! it probably contains properties 
	! of newer Fortrans. J uses in linear programming matrix 
	! suboutines of Roger Fletcher which I changed to double precision. J provided many new possibilities
	! for preprocessing of data and postprocessing of results, and these computations
! can be uased  also without LP problems.
	! Even Bergseng from NMBU 
	! started to use J in a premature face and thus he had to tolerate quite much mix-up. The GAYA 
 ! started to use J in the planning system called thereafter GAYA-J. Mela has not
 ! included J as
 ! as the optimizer, but it is possible to pull out simulated schedules from Mela and then
 ! define and solve linear programming problems using J. 

! Simosol started to use J as an 
! optimizer from the beginning. Simosol has privately admitted, 
 ! that they using much J.
!  For some reason Simosol
 ! wants to keep this hidden from the users of their sofware and from the public. 
 ! It would be important for an open source software that 
 ! the users would rise a flag when they use the sofware. 
 ! This would give feedback to the developers 
 ! and would allow communication between users. 
 
 ! J version 2.0. published in 2013 made it possible optimize simultatenously
 ! forestry and transportations to factories
 ! and factory production. I extended the generalized upper bound tehcnique
 ! for constraints which tell that
 ! all harvested timber volume in a stand is transported somewhere. 
 ! Reetta Lempinen started to work with me in the factory optimization. 
 ! Reetta has professional
 ! training in programming, while I'm a self-learning amateur.
! Reetta had a clear head to keep complicated data structures I had created in order. 
	! She also maintained the spirit during the black moments. 
	 

	
	! \subsection*{J in Luke}
!\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{J in Luke}
	
	! When working with Reetta, I noticed how terribly dirty the code was. I started to clean the 
	! code.
 ! In 2015 Metla and 
 ! two other institutes were merged into Institute of Natural Resources Finland (Luke). 
 ! When my retirement was approaching, I suggested Luke that J would be published as
 ! an open source software so that I could continue its development after my retirement. 
! The leaders of Luke told that it is a good idea to open the software, and this is so important that
  ! Luke cannot let me take care of the publication but the leaders wanted to publish J
 ! themselves. This started a frustrating and humillating process which lasted until 7.10. 2021. None
 ! of the involved eleven leaders thought that the software had been even so 
 ! important that he/she had taken care that it had been eventually published. 
 
 ! The following leading persons were involved in
 ! process before my retirement in 2017: P\"aivi Eskelinen, Olli Salminen, Kari T. Korhonen,
 ! Kimmo Kukkavuori,
 ! Tuula Packalen, Sirpa Thessler, Sari Forsman-Hugg, Emilia Katajajuuri and Johanna
 ! Buchert. Iikka Sainio was an outside legal consult.
 ! After my retirement prof. Packalen and after she left Luke in 2020
 ! research director Antti Asikainen, head of adiministration Ilkka P. Laurila,
 ! and  the director general Johanna Buchert  
 ! took the control of the publication.

! In the previous version of this manual I wrote a detailed description of the process, e.g.
 ! of the farce related 
! to the subroutines of Roger Fletcher. Now I present only some key points.
 ! The process can be described as a hostile take over.
! The leading lawyer Emilia Katajajuuri stated it 
 ! explicitly: 'Listen Juha, you do not decide anything in this matter'. 
 !P\"aivi Eskelinen told that I should wait 
 ! patiently because the leaders want to prepare 
 !the publication carefully. 
 
 

! At the time when I retired in March 2017 I was told that the decision was 
! ready to be signed by Sari Forsman-Hugg.
 ! She was not able to decide, similarly as as she was not able to 
 ! decide whether Luke could take me as an outside researcher.
 
 
 ! Research director Johanna Buchert signed the opening decision 30. 8. 2017.
! Buchert nominated prof Packalen to take care of the launch.
 ! I was not informed of the decision. When I heard that such decision has been made, 
 ! I asked prof. Packalen what it contained.
 ! She did not remember. The software was used in a tiny research project utilizing factory optimization.
 ! I had sent to Luke a bug correction beleaving  that the 
 ! publication was approaching as prof Packalen had promised. She suggested a
 ! high-level launch with oversees attendees. I did not like such 
 ! launch because
 ! the software was not yet ripe
 ! for that. I would be ashamed if the prominent guests would look at the code.
 !Prof Packalen then prevented without any notice the publication altogether by not allowing
 ! Reetta Lempinen to do necessary preparations.
 ! Research director Buchert did not follow how prof Packalen was doing 
 ! the launch.
 
 ! Prof Packalen left Luke in June 2020 and could thus no
 ! more prevent the publication. 
 ! In February 2021 Hannu Salminen started to discuss 
 !with me of the development and utilization of J. 
 ! He was the first person in Luke's
 ! history wanting to discuss such things with me.
 ! A cooperation plan was made.
 ! I had made significant improvements and corrected a bug in the factory 
 ! optimization. I had difficulties to obey the six year's old request of P\"aivi Eskelinen to
 ! wait patiently, so I tried 
 ! to get J published during my life time. 
 ! I told the leaders of Luke in March 2021 that I will not send improved codes
 ! to Luke without an explicit co-operation agreement. 
 ! The research director Antti Asikainen answered 
 ! 'According to my understanding the IPR rights of J software belong to Luke'. 
 !The head of admininistration,
 ! Ilkka P Laurila wrote: 'Luke has started preparations for the publication'. 
 ! Laurila was not on my e-mail list,
 ! so evidently he answered on behalf of director general Johanna Buchert, who was. 
 ! After getting such a rejection to my co-operation offer, it was clear that
 ! I would not send any codes to Luke. The highest leaders of Luke 
 ! did evidently not care of research needs of Hannu Salminen and others 
 ! included in the planned project. 
 
 ! I decided to continue my co-operation only with the GAYA group.
 !  It had new interest 
 ! in co-operation as they were making a new simulator.
	
 
 
 ! The situation changed when Lauri Meht\"atalo was invited to become a professor of Luke. 
 ! He started to mediate 
 ! negotiations between me and Luke. Earlier Luke did not acknowledge that I 
 ! did exist in legal sense in this matter. Lauri was able to persuade the 
 ! research director Asikainen to make an U-turn.
 ! As some months earlier he did not see any co-operation with me possible,
 ! he was now interested to become
 ! a co-author in a forthcoming publication.  
 ! The negotiations started well, but finally I had to make an ultimatum to
 ! brake conclusively all conncetions to Luke before 
 ! the co-operation agreement was signed 7.10. 2021 in the 100 years celebration of NFI in  Kings Hall
 ! in the medieval Olavinlinna castle in Savonlinna.
 
 ! I got a
 ! permission to publish the software, and Luke agreed to 
 ! provide  treatment schedules simulated with Mela using NFI data from whole Finland and data
 ! from pulp mills and saw mills. 
 ! Luke should provide me access to CSC supercomputers.  Luke should distribute Jlp22 via Github.  This point
 ! was not necessary as Reetta adviced me how to use Github.
 
 
 !During the hostile take over, the leaders knew nothing of the code
 ! and the optimization algoritm,  and were not willing to learn these things. Packalen
 ! Salminen and Korhonen had some idea what the software can do.
! Thus the leaders did not know that
 !the code contained so much dirty code
 ! that it could not be maintained and developed without my assistance.
 ! For instance, the linear programming, the most important part of the software, 
 ! was coded into one 7000-line subroutine having 135 goto statements (do not tell anyone!). 
 !The new factory optimization was very immature, 
 ! the data structures were too complicated, the algorithm was inefficient,
 !and import and export were not included.
 !The software was a 32-bit software with single precision data vectors. To allow 
 ! large optimization problems, the software must be 
 !in 64-bit and in double precision. 
 ! Reetta could do some minor local maintenance work. But for 
 ! real improvements she should
 ! start from clean table.
 ! The code without my support
 ! provided only slightly better perspectives than a one-time exe- file.
 !Anyhow, it would be interesting to know how the leaders planned to publish
 !tens of thousand code and manual lines I had written indicating that they
 !had produced these lines.
 
 ! Markku Siitonen, the developer of the Mela software, used to say 
 ! 'You shall not steal more that you can carry'. The leaders were 
 ! stealing (legally as all big robberies are done) more than they could carry
 ! as they did not understand that their capture contained a large amount of dirty,
! heavy-to-carry code. 
 
  
 ! \subsection*{Rewriting the software}
!\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Rewriting the software}
 
 ! Open Jlp22 was published 22.4.2022 in a web-seminar, and it has been distributed in Github since then.
 ! It contained many errors, but I wanted to get it out of the control of Luke as soon as possible.
 ! After my retirement I have rewritten completely the software, 
 ! the most part after the agreement in 7.10.2021. 
 ! Only the sceleton and innermost loops in the optimization come from the time I worked 
 ! for Metla and Luke. The following manual tells what Jlp22 can do now.
 ! The factory optmization is under development, and I will be published it later. 
 ! Reetta has participated
 ! in testing, in addition to teaching the use of Github.

!Section intro Introduction
!Jlp22 can be used as is, i.e. using exe files. The User guide concentrates 
!on using binary files, but some reference is also made to additional possibilities offered
! by the open Jlp22 code.
!endsection

!Section intro1 Using Jlp22 exe files
!Jlp22 is a general program for many different tasks. In one end, Jlp22 is a programming language which
! can be used to program several kind of applications and tasks, starting from computing 1+1, either
!at sit> promt or inside a trasformation object. 
!In the other end, it contains many functions which
! can do several tasks in statistics, plotting figures, 
! deterministic and stochastic simulation and linear optimization. Forest planning with factories
!using jlp() function can take several hours. 
! The general Jlp22 functions and Jlp22 trasformations can be combined in many ways.

! There are several alternatives for doing general mathematical and statistical 
! computations available in Jlp22, most prominent being R. For  users of R, the most interesting
! functions in Jlp22 are evidently the linear programming functions which utilize the the structure
! of typical forest managment planning problems. The forest management planning can now 
!in principle be combined with factories. Just now a completely new version of factory optimization
! is under development, and thus it is not usable. R users can do general data management in R and use 
! Jlp22 only for linear programming. But after learning basics of Jlp22, it may be more 
! straightforward to do also data management in Jjlp22. 

! Jlp22 can now be used for general matrix computations. I have included in Jlp22 all matrix functions of 
! Matlab which I found useful in a consulting project. Jlp22 uses Gnuplot for making figures. 
! It is straigtforward to extend these graphics functions. Jlp22 can be used an
! interface to Gnuplot graphics.  Jlp22 contains many tools to deal with classified data. 
!endsection
 
 !Section intro2 Developing own Jlp22 functions in Fortran
 ! The user's of Jlp22 can utilize the open source of Jlp22 in principally two different ways. 
 ! Either the user can develop new versions of existing Jlp22 functions or the user can can make new functions.
 ! It both cases the user should make new developments using so called own functions, which can 
 ! be independently of the main Jlp22 functions. When modifying an existing Jlp22 function, the user should make a copy of the
 ! function under a different name. Then the old and new versions
! can exist simultaneously in the function
 ! space of J. It is very easy to add new functions in Jlp22 and even more easy to add new options.
 
 !When deloping a new methods in Jlp22, it is possible to first use the Jlp22 
 !script language to make developments.
 !Then the user can make an own function where the method is written in Fortran to make the method faster.
 ! When writing new methods in Fortran, the user can concentrate on essential parts of the method, and utilize 
 ! the standard data management services provided by Jlp22.
 !endsection
 
 
 
 
 


! The development of new Jlp22 applications is made easier with special input programming. Input 
! programming can generate efficiently several Jlp22 code lines with few lines so that any part of
! object names can be have indices. Jlp22 scripts can be read from include files which can contain
! sections, so that all code of a project can be stored in one file. Different sections can
! be executed by just writing the name of the section at sit> prompt.
!
!The code development is easy using efficient debugging tools. The output of a Jlp22 function is printed
! if the line ends with ';' or ';;'. After the code development, the printing can be put off without 
! changing the code by telling with ]Printresult[ variable whether ';' or ';;' or - results 
! are printed. During pause() the user can do any computations and print objects and
! then either continue or interrupt the process. With ]Debugconsole[ variable the user can
! tell whether pause() is generated after each command line read from an include file. With
!]Debugcode[ the user can tell wether pause() is generated after each line when Jlp22 interprets
! code made by the parser and which is packed into a transformation object.

!Jlp22 is now efficient program to do many kind matrix computations. After retirement I sold a client 
!an algorithm which I dad developed using J. I submitted the algorith using Matlab code, 
! and thus learned Matlab. Then I implemented all Matlab properties I found useful. 
! all arithemetical, trigonometric and logical funtions cand operate both on scalars and matrices.
! Some useful extensios to normal computation rules were addewd. Matrices can be made
! from submatrices, submatrices can be extracted from matrices and replaced by other
! matrices. 
!
!The list object is used to transimit and acces object lists. If the list elements are 
! objects called REAL variables, the the list can be used in matrix computaions 
! in the same way as column vectors.
!
! The input programming  has the following functions and capabilities.
!\begin{itemize}
!\item ;incl(file,form->) include code from file starting from a label, e.g. as ;ad1;
!\item ;do(i,ia1,ia2,step) generates input records in a loop
!\item ;if();then \\ !includes conditionally code
!\item objstart"i"end  ! replaces i in the text with the integer value of i. Combined with ;do()
! this provides possiblitesd to generate large numer of lines using only some linse
! ;goto()  ! code is obtained from a different place of an include file.
! ;elseif();then \\
! ;else \\
! ;endif
!\end{itemize}

! Jlp22 functions can have arguments and options. Options are used to trasnmit optional arguments
! to a function. Options are expressed as option->. If the option does not refer to a single object then
! the value of the option must be put into parentrhesi.In some cases the prence or absence of an argument passes an logical
! argument into a function. There tow groups of options, ordinaryy options and code options.
! Ordinalry options treansmit either object names or numeric values into a function.
! code options contain a short peice of code which is computed several times form within the function.
! E.g. func->sin(x) can tells the draw() function waht is the function to be drawn. If 
! computation of the codeoption rquires several lines, then thes lines can be 
! packed into a transformation object. E.g. if ]tr] computes the value of ]res[ REAL object, 
! then the func->tr(]res[) is used to tell how the function value is computed.




!Section special Special implicit functions
!The special functions are such that the parser uses these functions for special operations.
!Only list2() is function which also the user can use, but the parser is
! is using it implicitly. 
!endsection
!
!Section setoption setoption(): set option on
! When a function has an option then the parser generates first code
! setoption(...) where the arguments of the option are interpred in the similar way as
! arguments of all functions. Then the parser genarates the code for
! setoption() function in a special way. 
!endsection

!Section getelem0 getelem(): extracting information from an object
! The origin of this function is the function which was used in previous versions
!to take an matrix element, which explains the name. Now it is used to extract 
! also submatrices (e.g. a(1,-3,All)) , or to get value of an regression 
! function or to compute
!a transformation and then take argument object as the result. E.g. if ]tr[ is a transformation
!then the result of  ]tr[(]a[) is object ]a[ after calling ]tr[.
!endheader

!Section setelem setelem(): Putting something  into an object.

!Section sekava pupua
! Jlp22 is a general program for doing different tasks in data analysis, matrix computations,
! simulation and optimization. It is intended to be used mainly in different forestry related
! applications. It has superseded the previous linear programming software JLP (Lappi 1992).
! Most users are interested in applying Jlp22 in linear programming problems of forest management
! planning. Linear programming functions and examples are described in chapter 11. Jlp22 version
! 2.0 is introducing factory problems where transportation costs and factory capacities can be
! taken into account. Factory problems are also described in chapter 11. Shortest route to linear
! programming problems is to read basics of command generation programming from chapter
! 3.2, at least ;incl() function from chapter 3.2.3. Forestry LP-problem requires also use of
! data() function (chapter 9.1) and usually also linkdata() function (chapter 9.3). LPproblems are defined with problem() function (chapter 11.5) and the problems are solved
! with jlp() function (chapter 11.7). After version 2.1 it is possible to solve large ordinary linear
! programming problems without problem() function using zmatrix-> option in jlp()
! function. To access the weights of optimal treatment schedules and to get them into files
! requires use of Jlp22-transformations (chapter 4.) inquiry functions (chapter 11.11), IO-functions
! (chapter 8), loops (chapter 7.2). An example is given in chapter 11.
!
! Jlp22 is operated using text command lines, but it contains tools which make this kind of operation
! mode more efficient, e.g. input can be included from files so that a part of the input lines is
! reinterpreted, input lines can be generated using loop constructs etc. These properties are
! called here as input programming.
!endsection

!Section compo The main components of Jlp22 program 
! The structure of Jlp22 program
!Latex
! \begin{itemize}
! \item Input programming which generates text input for the parser (subroutine
! j\_getinput). Jlp22 commands are obtained:
!\begin{itemize}
!\item from sit> prompt
! \item form possibly nested include files
!\end{itemize}
! \item parser which generates from text lines integer vectors containing function indices,
! option indices and object indices (subroutine j\_interpret). 
!\item Function driver which executes the code in the interpreted integer vector
! (subroutine dotrans). The the function driver is using:
!\begin{itemize}
! \item Jlp22 functions which operate on arguments which are determined either as formal arguments or
! via options.
! \item Jlp22 objects
! \item Global variables and matrices
! \item Utility subroutines
!\end{itemize}

!Section gitload Loading the package

! The installation is here described from the viewpoint of an user 
!who just want to use Jlp22, not develop it (yet).

! The load zip button loads file Jlp22-master.zip. Copy this file into a proper folder.
! Let it be Jgit. Clicking the Jlp22-master.zip icon shows folder Jlp22-master in 
! 7Zip (if this is installed). Clicking unpack 7zip unpacks it to the folder Jgit. 
! Too many folder levels are avoided, if everyhing in folder Jlp22-master 
!is copied directly in
 ! folder Jgit.
 
 ! The jlp22.exe is the debug version of Jlp22 and Jlp22r is the release version.
! The debug version should be 
 ! used still used to set up a project. When everythings seems to work, the user
 ! can try the release version in production runs where the time is of some concern.
  ! Let us assume that the working folder is jtest.

 !Section start Using Jlp22, and Gnuplot and Rscript from Jlp22
 !This section tells how to install Jlp22, Gnuplot and Rscript from Jlp22
! so that the user can start
!  running the examples in file jexamples.inc.
 !endsection
 !Section install Installing Jlp22, Gnuplot and Rscript
 ! After loading Jlp22 from the Github, the folders of the exe files must be
!  put into the environmental variable PATH. In my computer the PATH contains line C:\textbackslash jlp22
! An ordinary user may use Jlp22 ans Jlp22r from the folder 
! Jgit\textbackslash Jlp22bin.

	! Let us then install Gnuplot. Go to page gnuplot.info, and select there download,
	! and in the download page select green 'download latest version', which loads 
	! 'gp543-min64-mingw.exe' (or similar), and if you let it install with usual yes-next procedures
	! gnuplot is installed  in folder c:\textbackslash program files\textbackslash gnuplot
!which should be placed into the environmental variable Path. 

!When adding new lines to the path, it is necessary to accept changes with two 'OK'.
!After editing PATH have effect only after restarting the computer.


	!If you plan to run R scripts from Jlp22, Rscript program mus be installed 
	! and the folder must be put into the PATH. In my computer the folder is
!	C:\textbackslash Program Files\textbackslash R\textbackslash R-4.1.2\textbackslash bin
	

	! endsection
	
	! Section runex Running examples
	
	! If you plan to edit the example file, copy jexamples.inc and jlp22.pdf  from jdocdemo folder into the Jtest folder. 
 ! It is not wise to start 
 ! working in the Jdocdemo folder, because if you load a new version of Jlp22 in a similar way into Jgit folder
 ! and allow the computer replace existing folders with the same name,
 ! you would loose the work done in Jgit folder.
 
 ! Open the command prompt and move to the directory 'jtest' by 'cd' commands. 
 ! It is possible to use Jlp22 also directly, but its necessary to use Jlp22 through the command prompt 
	! at this testing phase, because then, if Jlp22 crashes, the error messages do not disappear.
	! In first time, you may want to change 
	! the colors etc of the commant prompt (color may take effect only after
	! closing command prompt and reopening it). It may be reasonable to tick all editing
	! properties under the properties button of the command prompt.
 
 ! If you would like that when starting Jlp22 in this folder, Jlp22 immediately starts with examples,
 ! make file j.par to folder jtest and write
  ! to it
	
	! ;incl(jexamples.inc)
 
 ! It is possible to write to the first line of j.par 
 
 ! *3000
 
 ! which would mean that Jlp22 would generate intially 3000 named objects.
 
 
	! Then start Jlp22 by giving command Jlp22 at the command prompt.
	! If you have not done j.par file, write at the sit> prompt:  ;incl(jexamples.inc).
	! Alternatively you can diretly start in the jexamples.inc by launching Jlp22 by\\
!  Jlp22 jexamples.inc	
	
	! Jlp22 will then print all shortcuts available. You can run examples one by one by giving example shortcuts
! individually, or you can run all examples by shortcut ALL. If you give shortcut ALL, Jlp22 asks whether
! a ;pause is generated after each example ('pause after each example(1/0)>'). 
! Even if pause() is not generated after each example, it is generated after each plot. 
! This can be prevented by pressing <return> when Jlp22 asks value for fpause. Examples in the ALL section can anyhow be started
! at any point by putting label ';current:' to any point after label ;ALL: and giving shortcut
! 'current'. This is also handy when examples have errors which break the execution. If the errors are made 
! intentionally to demonstrate error situations, the interruption of excution after these intentional errors are
! prevented so that the jexamples.inc have command Continue=1 before the intentional error. Theafter the normal
! error handling is put on by command Continue=0.

! It is useful to keep the manual open and follow simultaneously the manual and the execution of examples.

 !Section objintro Jlp22 objects
 ! Jlp22 objects have a simple yet efficient structure. Each object is associatd with two integer vectors, one single precision vector, one double precision vector, 
 ! one vector of characters and one vector of text lines. All vectors are allocated dynamically.
 ! There are several object types which store data differently in these vectors.
 ! Object can be either simple or compound objects. Compound objects are linked to other
 ! objects which can be used also directly utilizing the standard naming conventions. All objects are
 ! global, i.e. also users can acces all objects. Some predefined objects are locked so that
 ! users cannot change them. 
 
 !There are three types of objects
 !\begin{itemize}
 !\item Named objects. The number of named objects is specified at the initilaization, 
 ! and it cannot be changed later. Deleting an object means deallocating all the allocated 
 ! vectors associated with the objects.
 !\item Temporary objects used to store intermediate results.
 !\item Temporary objects used to store the partial derivatives when computing the derivatives using
 ! the derivations rules.
!\end{itemize}

! Alongside the objects there is a vector of double precision values, call j\_v-vector. When an object is called a REAL
!object or variable, this vector is referenced. After the parts corresponding to named objects and
!those two sets of temporary objects, there is an area used to store numeric constants. If a REAL
! variable a has object number of 100 and constan 7 is in the  position 7000 in the v-vector,
! then a+7 can be presented as j\_v(100)+j\_v(7000). Thus after parsing, all arithmetic computations can be done wihtou reference to whether
! a variable is in the named part or constant part of the j\_v-vector.
!Because the numeric contants are at the end section of the j\_v-vector, 
!new space can be added for the numeric
! constants without mixing up parsed transformations.
!endsection



!Section system System requirement
! The current binary versions of Jlp22 are developed using Gfortran Fortran 90 compiler in MSYS2 MINGW 64-bit environment
! under Windows 10. 
! Binary versions are ordinary console applications. It is recommended that Jlp22 is used in command
! prompt window, so that 
! if execution of Jlp22 terminates unexpectedly, the error debugging information, remains visible.
! With the debug version the problematic line is indicated.
! See chapter ? for more information of error handling.
 
! See Jlp22.0 Development Guide to start develop the software or to add
! own functions. The development package contains, in addition to source code for
! the standard Jlp22 software, program Jmanual
! which can be used to generate Latex code for the manualand the the include file for
!examples.   The precompiler Jpre  writes necessary Fortran statements to access all global
! Jlp22 data structures, makes indentations and checks if-the and do strutures and gives
! better error messages for them than Gfortran.

! Figures are made with Gnoplot.
!Gnuplot is freely available at

 
 ! https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/gnuplot/5.4.2/
 
 ! Download  download gp542-win64-mingw.exe. This will install gnuplot on your windows
! system under C::\textbackslash Program Files\gnuplot\. Jlp22 will strat Gnuplot automatically when
! plotting figures if Gnuplot is on the PATH (see section Installing Gnuplot and Jlp22).
! Dcomentation is found also in \ref{gnu}

!endsection



!Section setup Set-up of J
! The maximum number of available objects cannot be changed during a Jlp22 session. It is determined during 
! the initialization. When Jlp22 is started it tries to read first file j.par from the default directory 
! (see 'During the first use' chapter): The first line must look like
! *2000
! where the number gives the maximum number of named objects.  If j.par is not available, the default 
! number of objects is 5000.
! Thereafter there can be in j.par file any number of Jlp22 commands executed directly (e.g. 
! you can give shortcuts for 
! commands which are handy e.g. when including repeatedly certain sections from include files). If you 
! want to go directly into a specific Jlp22-application, you can put into j.par the corresponding include 
! command.
! If Jlp22 is started from command prompt, there can be an include file name in the command line. This 
! include file is run after commands read from j.par if it is available.  ?TESTAA
!endsection

!Section firstuse	During the first use
! It is reasonable to have the exe versions and dll's found in 
!Jbin folder in one folder, and to make shortcuts for exe-files
! into all working folders. Edit the properties of the shortcut (right click the 
! shortcut icon) so that the starting directory is the working directory. Or 
! alternatively you can set the path to the folder containing Jlp22 executable and 
! run Jlp22 in your working directory. Copy also the file j.par into each working 
! directory.
! It is recommended that Jlp22 is run in the Command Prompt window even if it can be 
! run also directly from the program shortcut.
! Edit first the properties of the I/O window if you are using Jlp22 directly or from 
! the Command Prompt window. The properties of the I/O window can be changed by 
! right-clicking the-icon at the upper left corner. It is reasonable to make the 
! screen buffer rather large (large height) so that the whole history of the Jlp22 
! session can be seen (this is done in the layout sheet of the shortcut 
! properties). The default height of the I/O window is also probably too small. 
! The width should be at least 81. If you would like to use mouse in copy and 
! paste, put quick edit option on. Also the colours of the text and background of 
! the Jlp22 window should be made healthier for eyes (dark text, bright background).
! To see that Jlp22 is running properly, give your first commands at sit> prompt:
! sit>a=7.7;
! 
! The result should look 
! a=7.700000
! sit>
!It is possible to use arrow keys to gwt previous command lines.
!
! All input lines entered or generated by input programming at sit> prompt are 
! called commands. Commands are either input programming commands (input 
! commands) or commands that define operations in the Jlp22 working environment 
! (operation commands). Input commands and operation commands may read and 
! interpret more input lines before returning control to the command level.
! It is most convenient to develop Jlp22 applications using include files. There is 
! available in the jdoc-demo folder an include file jexamples.txt 
! which can be used to run all examples in this manual. If the include file
!is in the working directory you can run any example by wrting the name of the example
! in the Jlp22-window if you have given ';incl(jexamples.txt)' at the sit> pronpt. 
! The working environment of Jlp22 consists of named objects, temporary objects, 
! constants, functions, arithmetic operations and text paragraphs. Operation 
! commands define simple arithmetic operations or more complicated operations on 
! the data structures. Operation commands are defined using a transformation 
! language. In addition to operation commands, the same transformation language 
! is used to define transformation objects which are computed as a group, usually severl times,
! and which 
! can be linked in different ways to data structures or other 
!transformation objects.

!Section typo Typographical conventions
!In this manual function names are written in red, option names in blue, object types in
!capital letters, object names within the text are written in this color: ]Object[. Coloring of objects
! is not ready. Objects of a certain type are written using just the type. Thus
!  a DATA means a DATA object.
! Names like ]ob1[ are used as generic names for object and names like  ]var1[
! are generic names for REAL variables. An object with a special type is written 
! using the first letter in upper case and others in the lower case. Thus Matrix is a
! generic name for a MATRIX object.

!For functions that return real values or matrices which can be
! used directly in arithmetic or matrix operations, 
!the existence of output is not indicated.

!endheader
!endsection

!Section onames Object names
!Object names start with letter or with {$#}. Object names can contain any of 
! symbols {#%§/\_} Jlp22 is using '%' to name objects related to some other objects. 
! E.g. function stat(x1,x2,mean->) will store means of variables x1 and x2 into 
! variables x1%mean and x2%mean. Objects with name starting with '$' are not 
! stored in the automatically created lists of input and output variables when 
! defining transformation objects. The variable Result which 
! is the output variable, if no output is given, is not put into these lists.
! Object names can contain special characters (e.g. +-*=()) if these are closed 
! within ‘[‘ and ‘]’, e.g. a[2+3]. This possibility to include additional information
! is borrowed from Markku Siitonen, the developer of Mela software.
! If an transformation object is created with trans() function, and the
! intended global arguments are given in the list of arguments,
! then a  local object {ob} created e.g. with transformation object {tr} have prefix
! {tr/\} yelding {tr/\ob}. Actually also these objects are global, but their prefix
! protects them so that they do not intervene with objects having the same name in the
! calling transformation object.
! There are many objects intialized automatically.
! Some of these are locked so that the users cannot change them. In transformation objects
! there can be objects which are intended to be used only locally. These are protected
! by putting an unvisible prefix to the object names, but these can be anyhow accessed
! by writing the the prefix.
! Names of objects having a predefined interpretation start with capital letter. 
! The user can freely use lower or upper case letters. Jlp22 is case sensitive.
! All objects known at a given point of a Jlp22 session can be listed by command:
! print(Names)
!endheader

!Section copy 	Copying object: a=b
!A copy of object can be made by the assignment statement a=b.

!endsection

!Section delete delete_o() :deleting objects 
! When an object with a given name is created, the name cannot be removed. With 
! delete_0() function one can free all memory allocated for data structures needed 
! by general objects:
! delete_o(obj1,...,objn)
! After deleting an object, the name refers to a real variable (which is 
! initialized by the delete_o() function into zero).
!endheader
!Note  Other objects except matrices can equivalently be deleted by giving 
! command
! obj1,...,objn = 0
! This is because the output objects of any functions are first deleted before 
! defining them anew. Usually an object is automatically deleted if the object 
! name is as an output object for other functions.
!endnote
!Note One can see how much memory each object is using print(Names).
!endnote
!Note Deleting a compound object deletes also such 
! subobjects which have no meaning when the main object is deleted. But e.g. if a 
! data object is deleted then the as-sociated transformation object is not 
! deleted as the transformation can be used independently.
!endnote
!Note Files can be deleted with delete_f(file). See IO-functions for 
! details.
!endnote
!Note If the user has defined own new compound objects in the open source 
! Jlp22 software she/he needs to define the associated delete function.

! The following description describes shortly different object types available in 
! J. More detailed descriptions are given in connection of Jlp22 functions which 
! create the objects and in Developers' guide.

!endsection


!Section realo Real variables and constants
! A REAL variable is a named object associated with a single 
! double precision value. Before version J3.0 the values were in single
! precision, and thus this objecttype is still called REAL. 
! The 
! value can be directly defined at the command level, or the variable can get 
! the value from data structures.  E.g.
!endheader
!Ex2 hopo2
!  stat(D,H,min->,max->) ! Here arguments must be variable names
!endex2
!Ex2 real giving value to REAL
! a = sin(2.4) ! argument is in radians sind() is for degrees
! h = data(read->(x1...x4))   ! x1, x2 ,x3, x4 are variables in the data set, and 
! get their values when doing operations for the data.
!endex2

! All numeric constants appearing in transformations will be stored
! as double precision 
! constants.
! Intermediate results in arithmetic calculations are stored into unnamed REAL
! variables.

!Note All objects have also an associated REAL value. In order to make 
! arithmetic operations fast, the argument types in simple arithmetic functions 
! are not checked. If a general object is used as an argument in an arithmetic 
! operation, then the REAL value associated with the object is used. This will 
! usually prevent the program to stop due to Fortran errors, but will produce 
! unintended results.
!endnote

!Note  In this manual 'variable' refers to a Jlp22 object whose type is REAL.
!endnote
!endsection

!Section charo Character constants and variables
! Character constants are generated by closing text within apostrophe signs ( ' 
! ). Apostrophe character ( ' ) within a character constant is indicated with (~) 
! (if the character ~ is not present in the keyboard, it can be produced by <Alt 
! >126, where numbers are entered from the numeric keyboard) Character constants are used e.g.  in I/O functions for file names, formats 
! and to define text to be written.  , e.g
!endheader
!Ex2
! a = data(in->'file1.dat', read->(x1,x2)) &
!endex2

!Ex2
! write('output.txt', '(~kukkuu=~,4f7.0)', sqrt(a)) & 
!endex2
!Latex
! Character variables are pointers to character constants. An example of a 
! character variable definition:

!endlatex 

!Ex2
! cvar='file1.dat' & 
!endex2
!Latex
! After defining a character variable, it can be used exactly as the character 
! constants.
!/endlatex
!Note The quotation mark (") has special meaning in the input programming. See 
! Input programming how to use character constants within character constants.
!endnote
!endsection

!Section textob	Text objects
! Currently there are two text object types, the old text object TEXT and the new 
! TXT. The TEXT object stores text in a long vector of single characters. The TXT
! object stores text in lines of 132 characters. The TEXT objects save memory but
! are not so easy to modify and use. Several Jlp22 
! functions create associated text objects. Jlp22 functions text() and txt() 
! can be used to 
! create text objects directly. All the names of Jlp22 objects are also stored in a 
! TEXT object called Names. The number of lines in a text objects can be obtained 
! with nrows() function and the total number of characters can be obtained with 
! len() function.
!endsection

!Section logical0	Logical values
! There is no special object type for logical variables. Results of logical 
! operations are stored into temporary or named real variables so that 0 means 
! False and 1 means True. In logical tests all non-zero values will mean True. 
! Thus e.g. if(6)b=7 is legal statement, and variable b will get value 7. E.g.
!endheader
!Ex2 
! sit>h=a.lt.b.and.b.le.8 &
! sit>print(h) &
! h=   1.00000 &

! An object list is a list of named Jlp22 object. See Shortcuts for implicit object 
! lists and List functions for more details. Object lists can be used also as 
! pointers to objects, see e.g. the selector option of the simulate() function.
!endsection



!Section matrixo	Matrices and vectors
! Matrices and vectors are generated with the matrix() function or they are 
! produced by matrix operations, matrix functions or by other Jlp22 functions. E.g. 
! the data() function is producing a data matrix as a part of the compound data 
! object. Matrix elements can be used in arithmetic operations as input or output 
! in similar way as real variables.
! See Matrix computations.
!endsection


!Section transo Transformation object
! A transformation object groups several operation commands together so that they 
! can be used for different purposes by Jlp22 functions and Jlp22 objects. A 
! transformation object contains the interpreted transformations. For more details 
! see Jlp22 function for defining transformation objects: trans().
! Transformation objects can be called using call() function, so that all 
! transformations defined in the object are done once. Function result() also calls 
! transformations but is also returning a value. When transformation objects are 
! linked to data objects, then the transformations defined in trans-formation object 
! are done separately for each observation.
! There is an implicit transformation object $Cursor$ which is used to run the 
! command level. The name $Cursor$ may appear in error messages when doing 
! commands at command level.  An-other transformation object $Val$ which is used to 
! take care of the substitutions of "-sequences in the input programming. Some Jlp22 
! functions use also implicitly transformations object $Cursor2$.

!Section storageo	Storage for variables
! Especially in a simulator it may happen that a set of variables have certain 
! values but the same variables are used for other purposes for some time and 
! then one would like to get the previous values. There is special Jlp22 object used 
! to store the values, and special store() and load() functions to deal with the 
! storage.
!endsection

!Section bitmatrixo	Bitmatrix
! A BITMATRIX is an object which can store in small memory space large matrices 
! used to indicate logical values. A BITMATRIX object is produced by bitmatrix() 
! function or by closures() function from an existing bitmatrix. Bitmatrix values 
! can be read from the input stream or file or set by setvalue() function. The 
! values of bitmatrix elements can be accessed with value() function.

! TRACESET is an object created by ;trace() function which is used by 
! tracetest() function to test if a set of variables has been updated. See

!Section cominout Command input and output
! Jlp22 has two programming levels. First level, called input programming, generates text lines which are then
! transmitted to the parser which generates code which is the put into transformations sets or 
!excuted directly. Input programming loops make it possible to generate large number of command lines 
! in a compact and short form. This chapter describes input programming concepts and commands.
!endsection
!Section inpuline Input record and input line 
!Jlp22 reads input records from the current input channel which may be terminal, file or a text object.
! When Jlp22 interprets input lines, spaces between limiters and function or object names are not
! significant. In input programming, functions start with ';' which is part of the function name (and
! there can thus be no space immediately after ';'). If a line (record) ends with ',' ,'+', '*´, '-',
! '(', '=' or with '>', then the next record is interpreted as a continuation record and
! the continuation character is kept as a part of the input
! line. Tf a record ends with ',' and the next record starts also with ',', only one ',' is obtained. If a line ends with '>{}>', then
! the nex line is also continuation line, and  '>{}>' is ignored. All continuation
! records together form one input line. In previous version input programming functions operated on input lines
! but now they operate on recors. One input record can contain 4096 characters, and an input line can contain also 4096 characters
! (this can be increased if needed).
! There can be comment lines within a command line.  

! When entering input lines from the keyboard, the previous lines given from the keyboard can no more be
! accessed and edited using the arrow keys owing to MSYS2 MSYS environment used to build the exe-file.
! To copy text from the Jlp22 window into the clipboard right-click the upper left icon, select Edit,
! and then select Mark. Next click and drag the cursor to select the text you want to copy and
! finally press Enter (or right-click the title bar, select Edit, and in the context menu click Copy).
! To paste text from the clipboard into the Jlp22 command line right-click the title bar, select Edit,
! and in the context menu click Paste. Console applications of Intel Fortran do not provide copy
! and paste using <cntrl>c and <cntrl>v. An annoying feature of the current command window is that it is possible 
! All input lines starting with '*' will be comments, and in each line text starting with '!' will also
! be interpreted as comment (!debug will put a debugging mode on for interpretation of the
! line, but this debug information can be understood only by the author). If a comment line starts
! with '*!', it will be printed.
!endsection

!Section inpupara Input Paragraph
! Many Jlp22 functions parsed and executed (interpreted) at the command level need or can use a group of
! text lines as input. In these cases the additional input lines are immediately after the function.
! This group of lines is called input paragraph. The input paragraph ends with '/', except the
! input paragraph of text function ends with '//' as a text object can contain ordinary input
! paragraphs. It may be default for the function that there is input paragraph following. When
! it is not a default, then the existence of the input paragraph is indicated with option in->
! without any value. An input paragraph can contain input programming commands; the
! resulting text lines are transmitted to the Jlp22 function which interprets the input paragraph

!Section short Shortcuts
!Command shortcuts are defined by defining character variables. When entering the

!shows an useful way to organize shortcuts and include files.

!Section inpuprog Input programming
! The purpose of the input programming is to read or generate Jlp22 commands or input lines
! needed by Jlp22 functions. The names of input programming commands start with semicolon ';'.
! There can be no space between ';' and the following input programming function. The syntax
! of input programming commands is the same as in Jlp22 functions, but the input programming
! functions cannot have an output. There are also controls structures in the input programming.
! An input paragraph can contain input programming structures.
!endsection

!Section inpuad  Labels in input programming

! The included text files can contain labels. Labels define possible starting points for the
! inclusion or jump labels within an include file. A label starts with semicolon (;) and
!ends with colon (:). There can be text after the label and the text is printed but
! otherwise ignored.\\

!endheader

!Ex2

!endex2


!Note The definition of a transformations object can also contain labels. These labels start
! with a letter and end also with colon (:). When defining a transformation object with trans() function,
! the input paragraph can contain input programming addresses and code labels. It is up to 
! input programming what code alabels become part of the transformation object.
!endnote


!endsection



!Section inpureplace Changing "i" sequences
! If an original input line contains text within quotation marks, then the sequence will be replaced
! as follows. If a character variable is enclosed, then the value of the character variable is
! substituted: E.g.
! directory='D:/\j/\'
! name='area1'
! extension='svs'
! then
! in->'"directory""name"."extension"'
! is equivalent to
! in->'D:/\j/\area1.svs'
! If the "-expression is not a character variable then Jlp22 interprets the sequence as an arithmetic
! expression and computes its value. Then the value is converted to character string and
! substituted into the place. E.g. if nper is variable having value 10, then lines
!Listing
! x#"nper+1"#"nper" = 56
! chv = 'code"nper"'
!endlisting
! are translated into
!Listing
! x#11#10 = 56
! chv = 'code10'
!endlisting

! With " " substitution one can define general macros which will get specific interpretation by
! giving values for character and numeric parameters, and numeric parameters can be utilized in
! variable names or other character strings. In transformation sets one can shorten computation
! time by calculating values of expressions in the interpretation time instead of doing
! computations repeatedly. E.g. if there is in a data set transformation
! x3 = "sin(Pi/4)"*x5
! Then evaluation of sin(Pi/4) is done immediately, and the value is transmitted to the
! transformation set as a real constant.
! If value of the expression within a “” sequence is an integer then the value is dropped in the
! place without the decimal point and without any spaces, otherwise its value is presented in
! form which is dependent on magnitude of the value. After J3.0 the format can be explicitly
! specified within [] before the numeric value. Eg. text can be put into a figure as
! fig =
! drawline(5,5,mark->’y=”[f5.2]coef(reg,x1)“*x1+”[f5.2]coef(reg,1)“‘)

!Section dots ...  sequences 
!It is often natural to index object names, and often we need to refer object
! names having consecutive index numbers or index letters. In Jlp22 versions before version 3.0 it
! was possible to generate object lists using ... -construct which replaced part of
! the input line with the names of objects being between the the object 
! name before ... and after ... . Now the dots construct is no more done as
! part of the input programming but in the interpret subroutine which interprets the
! input line and generates the integer vector for function and argument indices.
!But as dots work as if it would be part of the input programming, it is presented in this

!Section jtrans Jlp22 transformations
! Most operation commands affecting Jlp22 objects can be entered directly at the command level or
! packed into transformation object. In both cases the syntax and working is the same. A
! command line can define arithmetic operations for real variables or matrices, or they can
! include functions which operate on other Jlp22 objects. General Jlp22 functions can have arithmetic
! statements in their arguments or in the option values. In some cases the arguments must be
! object names. In principle it is possible to combine several general Jlp22 functions in the same
! operation command line, but there may not be any useful applications yet, and possibly some
! error conditions would be generated.
! Definition: A numeric function is a Jlp22 function which returns a single real value. These functions
! can be used within other transformations similarly as ordinary arithmetic functions. E.g.
! weights() is a numeric function returning the number of schedules having nonzero weight
! in a JLP-solution. Then print(sqrt(weights())+Pi) is a legal transformation.
!endheader
!endsection

!Section jfuncs0 Jlp22 functions
! The structure of Jlp22 functions is easiest to explain using an example.
!For instance a data object can be created with \\
! data2=newdata(matrx,matrz,read->(x1...x3,z1...z4),maketrans->mt) \\
! Here ]data2[ is the output, ]matrx[ and ]matrz[ are matrices having equal number of rows. Matrix 
! ]matrx[ has 3 columns, ]matrz[ 4. read-> is an option which tells
! what are the variable names in the data. x1...x3 is equivalent to x1,x2,x3.  Option   
!maketrans->mt tells that for each observation the trasformations defined in the trasformation
! object ]mt[ are computed from variables x1...x3 and z1...z4. The output variables
! whose names do not start with $ are included in the DATA object. 
 

!A function call obtained from the  input programming can have the 
! following components separed with commas. 
!endsection

!Section output Output of a function

!  There are the the following cases with respect to
 ! the output of the function
 
 ! \begin{itemize}
 
 !\item The function appears in a code line looking like\\
! Output=func()\\
!Then the function produces an object ]Output[. The type of the ]Output[ depends on the function.
! Several functions produce additional objects whose name start with ]Output%[. The
! object ]Output[ may or may not store links to these object. If such links are 
! stored then the output is a compound object. An objects to which there is a link, is called a subobject.
! Objects without such links are called side objects. For instance linear programming function jlp()
! does not produce any object with name ]Output[ just several side objects. 

! \item The expression \\
! func()\\
! is equivalent to\\
! Result=func()
! \item If code line is Output=func(); or func(); the Output or Result are printed if
! variable Printvalue has value 1 or 3.  If code line is Output=func();; or func();;
! if variable Printvalue has value 2 or 3.  

! \item Output is a temporal object. If a function is part of arithmetic computations, then
! the intermediate results are stored into temporary objects according to the parse tree. Thus in the
! expression y=sin(x)+cos(x), sin(x) produses first a temporary object and cos(x)
 ! another temporary object.
 ! \item Output is a submatrix of a MATRIX object. If A is a 4x4 matrix, and
 ! B is a3x3 MATRIX,then expression\\
! A(2,-4,1,-3)=B\\
! puts MATRIX B into A.
!\end{itemize}
!endsection

!Section functionname Function names

!  Function name can be be any of the four cases.
! \begin{itemize}

! \item A standard Jlp22 function,
! \item An arithmetic or logical function obtained when translating the code into the polish notation.nslated first into
 ! Thus \\
! if(region.eq.savo)c=2*3+4;\\
! is translated into \\
! if(EQ(region,savo))c=PLUS(MULT(2,3),4);\\
! The user can try directly the above translated form
! \item An own-function of the user included in the function space.

! \item Implicit function generated with the parser. For instance, options are implemented using 
! setoption() function.
! \item Jlp22 object which can be used as if it were a function. Currently there
! are four such cases

! the object cannot produce anything, there will be an error message:\\
! produce   but it is not a function or object which can provide something then
!there will be an error message:\\
!* (object name) cannot produce anything\\
!But if the object is REAL then the error message can be \\

!Section Data Data functions 
!Data functions can generate data objects by reading data from files, or forming data
! objects by combing matrices and data objects. An important property of data objects
! is that they can be linked so that each observation of an upper level data
! is linked to several observations in lower level data. Each upper level 
!observation can contain different number of lower level observations.
!Linear programming in forest management planning is based on linked data sets where each
!stand is connected to number of treatment schedules.

!Section jfunc Structure of general Jlp22 functions
! The general (non arithmetic) Jlp22 functions are used either in statements

! func(arg1,...,argn,opt1->value1,....,optm->valuem)

! or

! output=func(arg1,...,argn,opt1->value1,....,optm->valuem)

! If there is no output for a function in a statement, then there can be three different cases:
! Latex
! \begin{itemize}
! \item The function does not produce any output (if an output would be given, then Jlp22 would just 
! ignore it

! \item The function is producing output, and the default name {Result} is used for the output  
! for arithmetic and matrix operations.
! \item The function is a sub expression within a transformation consisting of several parts including 
! other function or arithmetic operations. Then the output is put into a temporary unnamed 
! object which is used by upper level functions as an argument (e.g. a=inverse(b)*t(c)) 
! \end{itemize}
!endlatex
! If the value of an option is not a single object or numeric constant, then it must be enclosed in 
! parenthesis.
! endheader

! Note : It is useful to think that options define additional argument sets for a function. Actually 
! an alternative for options would be to have long argument lists where the position of an 
! argument determines its interpretation. Hereafter generic term 'argument' may refer also to 
! the arguments of an option.
! endnote
! Note : When Jlp22 is parsing a function, it is checking that the option names and the syntax 
! are valid, but it is not checking if an option is used by the function. Also when executing the 
! function, the function is reacting to all options it recognizes but it does not notice if there are 
! extra options, and these are thus just ignored.
! An argument for a Jlp22 function can be either functional statements producing a Jlp22 object as its 
! value, or a name of Jlp22 object. Some options can be without any argument (indicating that the 
! option is on).

!Section comoptions Common options
! There are some options which are used in many Jlp22 functions. Such options are e.g.
!endheader
!Option
!@@in2 
!@@data
!All data sets will be
! treated logically as a single data set. 
! If the function is using data sets, the daenta sets are given in data-> option. All data sets will be
! treated logically as a single data set. If a Jlp22 function needs to access data, and the data->
! option is not given then Jlp22 uses default data which is determined as follows.
! If the user has defined an object list Data consisting of one or more data sets, then these will
! be used as the default data set. E.g.
! Data=list(dataa,datab)
! When a data set is created, it will automatically become the only element in LastData list. If
! the Data list has not been defined and there is no data-> option, then the LastData dataset
! will be used.
!@@trans
! In all functions which are using data sets, trans-> option defines a
! transformation set which is used in this function.

!Arg&1&TRANS& The transformation object executed.
!endoption

!The call() function can be used at the command level or within transformation object. Defining
!transformation objects which are called within other transformation sets one can use some
!transformation as subroutines. Lists can be used to transmit objects into transformation
!objects similarly as done in more advanced programming environ ments using arguments.
!Using input
!programming one can define transformations which get specific interpretation after giving
!values to character variables and object lists. But these transformations must be interpreted
!first with trans() function before they can be used. It is also possible to transmit lists 
!into interpreted transformations.
!endheader
!Note: A transformation objects can be used recursively, i.e. a transformation can be called from
!itself. The depth of recursion is not controlled by J, so going too deep in recursion will
!eventually lead to a system error.
!endnote
!Note Professional programmers would probably say that the integer vector produced with the parser
! is interpreted and not executed. An amateur programmer can be more flexible with terms.

!Section transfunc Using a transformation object as a function
! It is now possible to use a transformation object as a function which computes new
! objects when generating arguments for functions or options, 
! or values of code options, or in any place within a transformation object. 
! If {tr} is a transformation and the transformation computes an object {A} then
! {tr(A)} is first calling transformation {tr} and provides then object {A} into this place.
! As the transformation computes also other objects which are computed within it, also thes objects
! are available. At this point it is important to note that arguments of 
! a transformation line are computed from right to left, because options must be computed before
! entering into a function.

!Section arith Arithmetic and logical functions and operations
!Jlp has all the standard arithmetic and logical opertaions and functions.
!The arithmetic and logical functions return single REAL value or a MATRIX.
!endsection

! Section numer Numeric operations
! An arithmetic expression consisting of ordinary arithmetic operations is formed in 
! the standard way. The operations are in the order of their precedence.

! \item *** integer power
! \item ** or \^ real power
! \item * multiplication
! \item / division
! \item + addition
! \item - subtraction
! \end{itemize}
! endlatex

! The reason for having a different integer power is that it is faster to compute and a negative 
! value can have an integer power but not a real power.

 ! In matrix computations there are two additional opertations.

! \item .not. ~ negation
! \item .and. & conjunction
! \item .or. disjunction
! \item .eqv. equivalent.
! \item .neqv. not equivalent
! \end{itemize}

! The relational and logical expressions produce value 1 for True and value 0 for False. 
! Note: Testing equivalence can be done also using 'equal to' and 'not equal', as the same truth 
! value is expressed with the same numeric value.
! endlatex
! Note when the truth value of an expression is tested with if(), then all nonzero real values
! means that the expression is true.

! in one or two dimensional tables using data sets. There are also functions
! which can be used to compute statistics from matrices, but these are described 
! in Section  \ref{matrix}
!endsection

!Section matrixf  Matrix functions
! There are matrix function which can create matrices (objects with type Matrix), take submatrices from larger matrices,
! make matrices from submatrices, compute statitics from matrices, solve linear equations,
! compute inverse and transpose of a matrix.
! Sums, differences and products of matrices are defined using ordinary arithmetic
! operations +,- and *. Arithmetic operations can combine scalars and matrices in the normal way.
! Now all matrices are in double precision. 

! The arithemetic operations work for matrices as follows for arguments ]a1[ and ]a2[
! \begin{itemize}
! \item ]a1[ + ]a2[
! \begin{itemize}
 ! \item ]a1[ and ]a2[ can be compatibe matrices 
! \item ]a1[ or ]a2[ can be scalar (REAL) and the other argument is MATRIX.
! \item ]a1[ or ]a2[ can be row vector and the other argument 
! can be matrix having the same number 
! of columns. Then the row vector is added to each row of the matrix. This is NONSTADARD.
 ! Similarly the other argument can be a colun vector and the other argument matrix having the same number of rows.
 ! Then the vector is added to each column of the matrix. NONSTANDARD.
! \end{itemize}
 
! \end{itemize}

! The same computation rules apply for operations -, *. (elementwise product), and
! /. (elemetwise division). The same rules apply also for logical operations, 
! except the nonstandard rules do not apply.

! For multiplication ]a1[ * ]a2[, either of the arguments can be scalar,
 ! and the other matrix or LIST of REAL objects.
! When ]a1[ and ]a2[ are matrices, standar matrix multiplication rules apply.

! When ]a1[ or ]a2[ is LIST of REAL values then, it works exacty as
 ! a column vector, when it is on the input side.  The elements are eqaul 
 ! to the values of the REAL elements. When a LIST is an output of matrix 
 ! computaions, the an error occurs if the output of the matrix operation is
 ! not comaptibel with the number of elemets in the LIST.

!endsection

! Section basicloop Looping between j\_getinput, j\_parser and dotrans
! The are three key subroutines in Jlp22 operation.
! \begin{itemize}
! \item j\_getinput gets a new command line from the console, an include file. j\_getinput can 
! read several records to make one command line, and it can edit or duplicate the input
! with special \textbf{input programming} tools. Jlp prints sit> prompt
 ! when reading form the console. Input programming lines are indicated with initila \%.
! \item If the obtained input line is not an input programming command or if it is not 
! captured by some function which is utilizing j\_getinput, the line goes to j\_parser which
! generates an integer vector.
! \item The integer vector produced by the j_parser is interpred ('executed' in this manual)
! with dotrans subroutine.
! \item trans() function packs several lines generated in j\_getinput - j \_parser loops
! into a tranformation (TRANS) object, which can be called from different functions.
! \item dotrans subroutine executes a single line command which is not part of an TRANS object.
! Jlp22 writes '#' in te front of the line.
! \end{itemize}
! endsection

!Section printing Printing of Jlp22
!Jlp22 prints information of the proceeding of the control. There are different ways to control
! the output. Finetuning is needed in the output. There are three logical 
!stages in the flow of the control. The output indicates these as follows.
!endsection

!Section printinpu % -lines are printed from input programming
! The input programming lines are printed starting with %. 
! The amount of printing is controlled with ]Printinput[ variable. 
! the dafault is Printinput=1. A problem in printing the input is how much should be
!printed when many input lines are produced with ;do()
!\endsection

!Section printcommand # -lines are printed in one-line commands.
! The input lines which go directly to execution are printed starting with #.
!\endsection

!Section printoutput ]Printoutput[ guides printing of functions.
! The amount of printing in functions is guided with with variable [Printoutput[.
!The default is \\
![Printoutput[=2\\
!Several functions have print-> option which overrules ]Printoutput[
! The number of printed lines when printing MATRIX,TEXT, or TXT is controlled with 
!variable ]Maxlines[, which is overruled with maxlines option in some functions.
!\endsection


!Section interactive Interactive operation
! In the interactive operation, Jlp22 may first read commands from the
! default ;incl -file or from the file specified when starting the software,e.g. using\\
! Jlp22 myincl.inc \\
! or with the release version
! Jlp22r myinc.inc\\
! where myinc.inc is the file giving the initial commands. If command 'end' is read, then the program exites.
! But after reading an ;incl-file to the end or up to ;return, or after encountering an error, the Jlp22 starts
! to read commands from the console using 'sit>' -prompt, where the user can give 
! operation commands or new ;incl -command or 'end'.

!In the interactive operation, the processing of sripts can be interrupted with ;pause, and
! execution of TRANS can be intterrupted with pause(). Even if they are described in 
! 'Command input and output' and 'Jlp22 transformations' chapters, descriptions 
! are repeated here as they are useful in the interactive operation of Jlp22.
!endsection

!Section batch Batch mode 
!If the default main program is replaced with a program which tells that Jlp is operated 
! in the batch mode, or if the initial   ;incl -file containscommand batch(), the Jlp22 is operated in
! the batch mode. In the batch mode, the control never starts to read commands from the 
! console at sit> prompt. Using Jlp22 from R, developed with Lauri Meht\"atalo is using Jlp22 in the batch mode.
!endsection

!Section operation2 Using shortcuts and sections in ;incl files

!It is useful to organize
! the project sript into one script file, which conatians swections starting with a lable and ending
! with ;return. 
! I think that it is more difficult to have several script files.
 ! The example file jexamples.inc is a good example of a script file.
! !The script files should start with shortcuts for each section. If it is possible that 
! different versions of the same script file are stored in different names, it is useful to have
 ! as first line something like
 ! this=thisfile()\\
 ! Then it is not necessary to change anything if the file is stored in a different name.
 ! Thereafter comes the shortcut definitions for different sections.
 ! the same 
! For instance, if the the section
! label is \\
! ;thistask:\\
! then the shortcut definition could be
! thistaskh=';incl(this,from->thistask)'\\

! The section should end with\\
! ;return\\
! After defining shortcuts for all sections, it is useful to have a shortcut as:\\
! again=;incl(this)\\
! If new sections are added, then one needs to give just shortcut\\
! again\\
! and then the new shortcuts will be defined. It does not matter if the earlier shortcuts are redefined. 

! The last shortcut could be \\
! current=';incl(this,from->current)
! The label 'current' can be a floating label which is put into the section which is under developed
! in place the problems started.

! If a Jlp22 code line, either in the input paragraph defining a transformation object
 ! or outside it, ends with ';' or ';;', the the output object of the code line may be printed.
! The output of ';'-line is printed if the variable ]Printoutput[ has value 1 or 3 at the time when the the
 ! code line is computed.
 ! The output of ';;'-line is printed if the variable ]Printoutput[ has value 2 or 3 at the time when the the
 ! code line is computed.
 
 ! If a code line within a tranformation has function pause('text'), then a pause is generated during which
 ! the user can give any commands except
 ! input programming commands. If the user will press <return> then the exceution continues. If the user
 ! presses 'e' and <return>, the control comes to the sit> promt similarly as during an error.
 
 ! If the line outside the transformation definition paragraph is ';pause', then
 ! a similar pause is generated except also input programming commands can be give.
 
 ! If the variable ]Debugtrans[ has value 1, them a pause() is genertated before each line within
! a tranformation object is executed.  If variable ]Debugconsole[ has value 1, 
! a ';pause' is generated before  the line is excuted. In bot cases the user can

!ote Using ;incl() in a project
!When working in a project it is reasonable to organize
!the include file as follows. Put into the beginning of the file section:\\
!this=thisfile()  !There can different versions of the file with differetn names.\\
!A=';incl(this)' !If new sections are added to the file, new shortcuts
!can be defined by adding those here and writing A at sit> prompt.\\
!R=';incl(this,from->read)'     ! read data in \\
!T1=';incl(this,from->task1)'   ! first analysis \\
!T2=';incl(this,from->task2)'   ! second analysis \\
!;return \\
!Now everything what needs to written at sit> after the first
!;incl() are the shortcuts. If adding section task3 then
!add the shortcut here, then write shortcuts A and T3 at sit>.
!The file jexamples.inc which comes with the manual and which is generated
! with the jmanual program shows an examle.



!Section own o1_funcs(), o2_funcs() and o3_funcs() calls own functions
! The users of open Jlp22 can define their own functions using three
! available own-function sets. In addition to own functions open Jlp22 is ready to
! recognize also own object types and options which are defined in the source files
! controlled by the users. The main Jlp22 does not know what to do with these own 
! object types and options, they are just transmitted to the own-functions.
! In the main Jlp22 the control is transmitted to the own functions using implicit
! Jlp22 functions o1_funcs(), o2_funcs() and o3_funcs().

! !The arithmetic and logical operations are first converted into the polish notation.
! The logical operations follow the same ruels as addition +. The following rules,

 ! order of arguments is changed,
! \begin{itemize}
! \item MATRIX + REAL : REAL is added to each element

! \item MATRIX1+MATRIX2 :: elementwise addition, if matrices hav comptaible dimensions
! \item  MATRIX+ column vector: column vector is added to each column of MATRIX 
! if the numbers of rows agrees.
! \item  MATRIX+ row vector: row vector is added to each 
! row of MATRIX 
! if the numbers of columns agree.

! Section future Future development
!The previous version contained possiblities to include factories into the optimization.
! Factory optimization is not available in the current version, because I'm now 
! building a completely new version. I have already cleaned the data structures
! of linear programming
! and put the algorithm into reasonable subroutines. This makes it possible to
! follow and optimized the
! the flow of control. This made it already possible to put ordinary linear programming
!into a separate jlpz() function.

! I think that the current version of Jlp22 provides many possibilities for future developments.
! For instance:
! \begin{itemize}
! \item\item The current version does not have any special functions 
! for making simulators. The new goto() commands, possibility to work with submatrices, 
! and the new transdata() function provide much more efficient ways to develop simulators.
! Examples will be provided shortly.
! \item Using the possibility to compute derivatives using the analytic derivates makes it quite straightforward
! to make it possible to have a nonlinear objective function and nonlinear constraints. These things
! are under design.
!\item It would be quite easy to inclued tools for piecewise linear constraints
!and objectives.
! \item It would be quite easy to develop Jlp22 so that integer solution is produced with respect to the 
! schedule weight.
! \item It would be interesting to see how Jlp22 can put to work with Heureka.
! \item The possiblity to run R scripts from Jlp22 and Jlp22 scripts from R provide new possiblities.
! \item Jlp22 can now be used as an interface to Gnuplot. 
! Google search show how many possiblities Gnuplot provides.
! It is quite straightforward to implement these graphs if it is not currently possible.
! \item The possibility to generate random numbers from any discrete or continuous distribution provide new 
! possibilities to study the effects of random errors in the optimization.
! \item The new tools for analyzing grouped data are useful when studying the grouped data. it would
! be straightforward to implement mixed model methods based on expected means squares.
! \end{itemize}

! Section LP Linear programming theory
! This chapter will later describe more closely the theoretical aspects of the linear programming
! functions. Now only some key concepts are listed. Now the reader is referred to the old
! JLP manual (Lappi 1992) and Hyv\"onen et al 

! The concepts in the JLP algorithm


! \begin{itemize}
! \item In a optimization problem with schedules generated for each stand, there must be a area 
! constraint for each stand telling that shares of schedules add up to one in each stand.
! \item In the generalized upper bound (GUB) technique of Dantzik and van Slyke, the area contraints can
! be dropped with slight overhead cost.
! \item The heuristic algorithm of Hoganson and Rose (1984) and 
! Hoganson and Kapple (1991) lead to similar computations where a schedule
 ! in  a stand is selected using shadow prices. Their shadow prices are updated heuritically but 
 ! JLP algorith updates the prices using the linear programming theory.
 ! \item The key concept in GUB is the key variable, in our case the key schedule, which is
 ! any of the schedules which has nonzero weight.
! \item JLP algorithm is also using the ordinary upper bound technique. If there is both
! lower and upper bound in a contraint, the standard theory assumes that the lower bound and upper bound
! constraints are presented  as different constraints. In the ordinary upper bound technique there
! is only one constraint, and the algorithm keeps either of the bounds as the active bound.
! \item JLP of Lappi (1992) introduced domains, i.e.. subsets of stands into the problem
! defition. They decrease the memory needs and help to formulate more reasonable problems.
! Their utility to define spatial constraints is not fully utilized.
! \item When a constraint is not binding, standard algorithms, a residual variable tells 
! the difference between the contraint row and the active bound. Algorithm of Lappi (1992)
! reduced the dimension of the basis matrix. 
! \item Lappi (1992) used own matrix subroutines which computed all the time the explicit inverse
! of the basis matrix. Jlp22 is using matrix routines of Fletcher based on Flethcer (1996)
! \item In Lappi and Lempinen (2014) the GUB technique is extended to deal with
! constraints telling that all harvested logs are transported to somewhere. Hyv\"onen et
! al (2019) applied the algorithm in a small project in North-Carelia. Note that the DTRAN algoritm can deal with 
! factories also.
! \item In optimization with factories, there is for any log type harvested in a given time a
! key factory to which something is transported.
! \end{itemize}
